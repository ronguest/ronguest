Support email was answered within an hour so I made the plunge. As with the 7300 I&rsquo;m happy with the switch though I do miss rig control.

They are generally also limited to 5W of transmit power. For repeater and simplex operation indoors at a minimum an external antenna is needed and a bit more power is helpful as well. For this reason a typical next step for a new ham, after a handheld, is to get a mobile transceiver and install an antenna.

				"title": "The Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up in theory but in practice they’ve undermined the value proposition",
				"content_html": "<p>When the Raspberry Pi 4 came out there was quite a fuss about how easily it had to throttle it’s cores due to heat under any sort of load. Throttling means it’s theoretical specs are not realized in the real world. The foundation issued several firmware fixes to address this over the past year.</p>\n\n<p>Based on my experience this is still a major issue. The foundation is making the situation worse by some odd choices they took. First they don’t include a heat sink on the processor (or anywhere else). Having heard of the heat issues I ordered a heat sink with mine and installed it right away.</p>\n\n<p>The second problem is the rather stupid decision they made to provide absolutely no ventilation in their official case. The top is completely solid. So they’re selling a CPU prone to overheating with no heat sink and no provision for passive ventilation in their case.</p>\n\n<p>The very first app I ran (other than the installer and Chromium) resulted in a flashing thermometer on the display indicating the Pi was throttling. I removed the top from the case and felt the heat sink - it was hot enough to burn a finger.

				"content_text": "When the Raspberry Pi 4 came out there was quite a fuss about how easily it had to throttle it’s cores due to heat under any sort of load. Throttling means it’s theoretical specs are not realized in the real world. The foundation issued several firmware fixes to address this over the past year.\n\nBased on my experience this is still a major issue. The foundation is making the situation worse by some odd choices they took. First they don’t include a heat sink on the processor (or anywhere else). Having heard of the heat issues I ordered a heat sink with mine and installed it right away. \n\nThe second problem is the rather stupid decision they made to provide absolutely no ventilation in their official case. The top is completely solid. So they’re selling a CPU prone to overheating with no heat sink and no provision for passive ventilation in their case.\n\nThe very first app I ran (other than the installer and Chromium) resulted in a flashing thermometer on the display indicating the Pi was throttling. I removed the top from the case and felt the heat sink - it was hot enough to burn a finger. I removed the top from the case, exposing the heat sink to open air, and the throttling decreased significantly. Since this experience every time I have the top on and run something that stresses the CPU it throttles. \n\nFor comparison I have a Pi 3 B+ in the attic. In a case. In Texas. In the summers. And it doesn’t over heat. \n\nI have a tiny fan I could use and to do something as suggested in [this guide](https://howchoo.com/g/zmvjzwmzmjm/add-raspberry-pi-4-cooling-fan) to install it in the case and implement automatic fan control.

				"content_html": "<p>For several years I&rsquo;ve done those things people say you should to track and manage diet and exercise/fitness. For over a year I logged everything I ate in MyFitnessPal, logged my weight daily, and used my iPhone/Apple Watch to track standing, movement and exercise. Each was helpful, at least in short bursts, but after each of my pushes the outcome was pretty disappointing. Flaws, to me, include the information being disjointed across these apps even though I could pull it all into the Health app on my iPhone. The data was just that - a bunch for data with a limited clue as to compliance and history. It was hard to see trends and to see how these different aspects of my life interacted. And MyFitnessPal (and it&rsquo;s ilk) are really tedious to do for any length of time. I also tried using automated tools in apps like Things and Day One to have me keep track myself and those didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stick&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t satisfy my complaints either.</p>\n\n<p>Since I wasn&rsquo;t happy with where I was health-wise and didn&rsquo;t feel like these tools were working for me I decided to take a different approach. And, once again proving I&rsquo;m a nerd, I decided a spreadsheet would better allow me to document my activity and dietary goals for each day and then to track compliance. So about a month ago I created a spreadsheet table with a column for each day and 4 rows of activities and 7 rows of dietary objectives. Even though it is a spreadsheet the cells are simply checkboxes. When I am compliance for the row I check off the box. Some items are positives like getting in my aerobic exercise for the day and others are negatives such as not eating a carb snack in the morning. The bottom row of the spreadsheet totals up the check marked cells. Achieving 7 is the bare minimum and earns a yellow status while 8 or more is good compliance and is a green status.

Below is a an example of a one week snapshot. Wednesday&rsquo;s is colored green because that was Christmas Day and I made that a complete cheat day. Friday and Saturday&rsquo;s compliance is poor due to a road trip (noted in a comment on Friday).

But by luck and much more competent woman became available. She got me checked in immediately, walked the phone to the back, and returned to tell me they would have it fixed in about 15 minutes.

This Shortcut prompts me for a file name and then a places on my iCloud Drive to save it. Picking a file name should be a built-in iOS feature for now it isn&rsquo;t. Typically for this to work it is necessary to first use the share sheet option to <em>Create PDF</em> and then run this workflow.

Once that was done I started from scratch once again and ended up with a Windows install that successfully booted my iMac. It performs pretty well i.e. much much faster than the Fusion boot camp partition. One of the resulting oddities is I can’t use the Boot Camp tool in Windows to boot into Mac OS X. I have to do a restart, hold the Option key, then pick the macOS boot disk. The second oddity is similar: the SSD no longer shows up as a bootable option in System Preferences on the iMac. It’s necessary to hold do the Option key when restarting and then pick a disk which is named “EFI Boot”.

I think it best to compare to laptop prices which start at a few hundred dollars for a basic model and rise to a couple of thousand.

I avoid it in real life and social media is no exception. I don’t know if the community on MB and the tools in the apps well be effective in managing this or not (e.g. mute doesn’t work right IMO). Time will tell but I am a bit hopeful.\n",

And AutoSleep works well.</li>\n    <li>Battery: I've had the watch a couple of weeks and I have never gotten it charged to 100% since I'm sleeping with the watch on. I usually charge the watch a couple of hours in the evening and with that the battery hasn't dropped below 18%.</li>\n    <li>Performance: It's great. Don't know what else to say about it.</li>\n    <li>Wallet: My Series 0 wasn't responsive enough to ever use the wallet/Apple Pay. I would always feel like a nerd when I tried and then it would fail in a shop full of people. The Series 4 works perfectly so I use the Wallet several times a week.</li>\n    <li>Connectivity: With all the options in Series 4 with cellular it has naturally been quite good. But it's only a 4/5 stars so far. Normally it will operate just fine if my iPhone is far away within the house or I leave it at home. But occasionally the watch seems to spend quite a bit of time figuring out it can't talk to the iPhone and needs to switch to WiFi or cellular as appropriate. The delay can be on the order of 10 seconds which is more than enough to be highly annoying. I'd rather it err on being more aggressive in connecting on it's own.</li>\n    <li>Health: Sometimes it would take me more than a minute on my Series 0 watch to start a workout. It was incredibly frustrating to have it lock up while trying to do so. Naturally it works perfectly now.

				"content_html": "<p>As chief technolust-er, procurement officer, and father of a couple of growing kids I have been thinking a lot about the optimal technology plan as our computers pass 5 years of age and the kids break into their teenage years. It used to feel like we needed a couple of computers plus iPads (not to mention phones and gaming consoles). I&rsquo;ve begun to question this assumption quite seriously but have found it difficult to come to a conclusion &ndash; partly because the kids&rsquo; preferences are mercurial and also the future demands of school work are unpredictable (e.g. our daughter is pursuing the digital animation track in HS).</p>\n\n<p>I decided to find a simpler elephant to eat, at least for now, and sat down and enumerated the tasks that drive me to use a Mac vs an iOS device. First up the list of &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be done on my iPad&rdquo; items.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>I use the <a href=\"https://www.iggsoftware.com/banktivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Banktivity </a>budgeting and finance management app. It has a richly featured iPad version that I use heavily. Unfortunately the iPad version is missing the full custom reporting package found on macOS. I only need to check these custom reports once or twice a month, and create new ones rarely, but it is a barrier to completely leaving a Mac behind.</li>\n    <li>Income tax preparation. I use TurboTax because I don’t trust doing it online and want to ensure I have the full ability to run it locally in the future.</li>\n    <li>Video processing/rendering (it's slow enough on my MBP)</li>\n    <li>Major Photo editing projects. There are a lot of great photo editing apps for iOS but I find them slow when dealing with large and RAW images. It's OK when processing one or two but I don't have enough time or patience for doing a large project using iOS apps.</li>\n    <li>Software and electronics development projects</li>\n    <li>A few random forms and web sites which don’t work properly on mobile Safari (can't believe companies can't get this right)</li>\n    <li>A couple of server processes (though these are no longer indispensable)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And now the list of &ldquo;could be done on my iPad but not as easily&rdquo;:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Heavy duty spreadsheet work. I spend a fair amount of effort managing investments and our financial plan. By way of example the Numbers spreadsheet that covers most of this has around 10 different tabs most filled with wide tables. I can do simple updates and tweaks on with my 10\" iPad Pro but the screen just isn't wide enough to permit simultaneous clarity of the details while at the same time enabling an effective big picture view. I've contemplated if the larger iPad Pro would be sufficient but I'm not sure. Added context: I have a wide screen monitor on my MBP.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>This one is a bit of a \"to be determined\" but I've long used Photos on the Mac to create our Christmas Cards and Calendars. Given Apple's decision I imagine this will become more difficult on the Mac. I have yet to explore options on my iPad so I'm not sure if the Mac will still have a clear advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This was a useful exercise for me. The &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be done on iPad&rdquo; list, though lengthy, is almost entirely comprised of activities I do infrequently. The only outlier is software and electronics development projects which tend to have me at a Mac throughout a day or a few days. The conclusion for me is I don&rsquo;t need a Mac any more. I can share a decent Mac with the kids.</p>\n\n<p>N.B. No actual elephants were harmed in the writing of this post. 🐘</p>\n",

First up the list of \"can't be done on my iPad\" items.\n\n<ul>\n    <li>I use the <a href=\"https://www.iggsoftware.com/banktivity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Banktivity </a>budgeting and finance management app. It has a richly featured iPad version that I use heavily. Unfortunately the iPad version is missing the full custom reporting package found on macOS. I only need to check these custom reports once or twice a month, and create new ones rarely, but it is a barrier to completely leaving a Mac behind.</li>\n    <li>Income tax preparation. I use TurboTax because I don’t trust doing it online and want to ensure I have the full ability to run it locally in the future.</li>\n    <li>Video processing/rendering (it's slow enough on my MBP)</li>\n    <li>Major Photo editing projects. There are a lot of great photo editing apps for iOS but I find them slow when dealing with large and RAW images. It's OK when processing one or two but I don't have enough time or patience for doing a large project using iOS apps.</li>\n    <li>Software and electronics development projects</li>\n    <li>A few random forms and web sites which don’t work properly on mobile Safari (can't believe companies can't get this right)</li>\n    <li>A couple of server processes (though these are no longer indispensable)</li>\n</ul>\n\nAnd now the list of \"could be done on my iPad but not as easily\":\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Heavy duty spreadsheet work. I spend a fair amount of effort managing investments and our financial plan. By way of example the Numbers spreadsheet that covers most of this has around 10 different tabs most filled with wide tables. I can do simple updates and tweaks on with my 10\" iPad Pro but the screen just isn't wide enough to permit simultaneous clarity of the details while at the same time enabling an effective big picture view. I've contemplated if the larger iPad Pro would be sufficient but I'm not sure. Added context: I have a wide screen monitor on my MBP.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>This one is a bit of a \"to be determined\" but I've long used Photos on the Mac to create our Christmas Cards and Calendars. Given Apple's decision I imagine this will become more difficult on the Mac. I have yet to explore options on my iPad so I'm not sure if the Mac will still have a clear advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThis was a useful exercise for me. The \"can't be done on iPad\" list, though lengthy, is almost entirely comprised of activities I do infrequently. The only outlier is software and electronics development projects which tend to have me at a Mac throughout a day or a few days. The conclusion for me is I don't need a Mac any more. I can share a decent Mac with the kids.\n\nN.B. No actual elephants were harmed in the writing of this post. 🐘\n",

However once configured HomeBridge provided trouble-free integration of our WeMo devices [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I could now use Siri to open and close my garage door[/footnote].

Fast forward a couple of years and I needed a new phone and after holding one at an Apple store I splurged for an iPhone X for Christmas.  A couple days later we leave for a vacation and it happens… a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion. Why you may ask?</p>\n\n<p>Live Photos are an amazing way to capture the <strong>perfect</strong> moment when photographing an individual or group. Remember how often someone&rsquo;s expression is just slightly off, or they have just started to blink and their eyes aren&rsquo;t completely open? Live Photos capture a few seconds in time and based on taking a few hundred photos on the trip are amazingly effective at capturing those “just right” expressions. All you need to do is scan through each frame of the Live Photo and pick the right key frame.</p>\n\n<p>I also discovered another thing about Live Photos. There can be a lot of humor captured in those few seconds as people start to mug for the camera or relax just after they think the photo is done. I found value in Live Photos even in landscape photos (e.g. at the beach). Those few seconds are often the prefect amount of time to capture a wave crashing on the beach or trees rustling in a forest - without the hassle of starting and stopping a movie capture. It just seems more natural and it really encourages short snippets of motion. At least for me, I always hated to fire up the video mode unless I was recording something that took awhile. It all sounds great, right, <strong>but</strong> …</p>\n\n<p>Apple in one of those odd decisions it makes provides no way to really leverage and share the motion captured in Live Photos. I was incredibly frustrated by this because many of the Live Photos I captured on the trip would have made a great video when stitched together. I did some searching for an iOS app to help and all the ones I found initially were lacking. Then, by some miracle, one of the women I follow on Twitter retweeted a request from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/becky\">@becky</a> for beta testers for an app called <a href=\"http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2018/01/29/snapthread-1-5/\">Snapthread</a>. She kindly agreed to add me as a beta tester and at first I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could pull off my project with the app. I feared I was still going to have to jump through the hoops to get them all into iMovie - not something I looked forward to at all. But I made a few suggestions to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/becky\">@becky</a> which she implemented virtually over night and viola I had the perfect iOS app for creating videos out of stitched together Live Photos. In fact Snapthread worked so well I integrated some movies taken from the trip with the Live Photos. When it was all said and done I and created 48 clips in Snapthread (from a few seconds to a few minutes)! Becky&rsquo;s app allowed me to quickly create and share memories from our vacation in a way just having some photos or videos could never have accomplished. And all made using my iPhone. Thank you Becky! Obviously I highly recommend <a href=\"http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2018/01/29/snapthread-1-5/\">Snapthread</a> and Becky is absolutely justified in saying this is the best app for combining and sharing Live Photos.</p>\n",

I'm a big believer in the growth of physical interaction with computing devices. In spite of this incarnation seeming a bit lame I think we will soon see some exciting innovations. And that 32-bit Arduino will likely be in the middle of things...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/27/disney-to-pair-ipad-physical-toys-with-new-games/\"></a></p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/27/disney-to-pair-ipad-physical-toys-with-new-games/\">Disney to pair iPad, physical toys with new games</a>\n",

I've experimented with several of the existing Wifi shields and their implementation all leave something (in fact a lot) to be desired. This official shield, coming soon for about $80US, will leverage support in the new Arduino 1.0 software as well as benefitting from a design that avoids the UART. This means it's functioning will be completely hackable. It has it's own processor so performance will also be superior as well. The Wifi shield should be available soon - but I won't be surprised if they sell out immediately.</li>\n    <li>Arduino Due - a Arduino with a 32-bit processor but that barely tells the tale on this one as it's I/O performance will kick some serious butt. This baby is due at the end of 2011 and will clearly push the frontiers of what's possible with an Arduino.</li>\n    <li>Arduino Robot System - this is a dual-Arduino robot system which is TinkerKit compatible.

Staying aware of these threats should be a basic part of life but used to entail either being glued to a weather broadcast on TV or constantly checking radar/warnings on a website. Sure, there are sirens outdoors but they can only be heard indoors under ideal conditions. However advances in weather radios and a new tool for iPhones provide a much better proactive notification solutions.</p>\n\n<p>For homes the top solution is a Weather Radio with S.A.M.E. technology. These radios will &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and sound an alarm if a threat occurs and, most importantly, allow you to specify exactly which dangerous conditions will generate the audible alarm.

				"content_text": "I live in an area where tornados and severe thunderstorms are a regular occurrence. Staying aware of these threats should be a basic part of life but used to entail either being glued to a weather broadcast on TV or constantly checking radar/warnings on a website. Sure, there are sirens outdoors but they can only be heard indoors under ideal conditions. However advances in weather radios and a new tool for iPhones provide a much better proactive notification solutions.\n\nFor homes the top solution is a Weather Radio with S.A.M.E. technology. These radios will \"wake up\" and sound an alarm if a threat occurs and, most importantly, allow you to specify exactly which dangerous conditions will generate the audible alarm.

After a bit of studying, ordering parts, and making a few runs to RadioShack I&rsquo;ve completed the prototype build of my first project. The goal is to create a multi-purpose motion detector. The key components of this build are the Arduino microcontroller, a Parallax passive infrared sensor, and a <a href=\"http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=17_21\">Adafruit Audio (WAV) shield</a> with a SD card for audio storage. Arduino processors have very little memory so the SD card is essential to play sounds of any complexity or duration.</p>\n\n<p>My current software manages the Infrared sensor, lights a LED when motion is detected and also plays a tone on a piezo device. The Audio shield has pretty low level hardware so the software to manipulate it is relatively complex and will take a little time to integrate. I built the Audio shield last night and tonight I integrated it with the PIR, LED and piezo and tweaked the software that senses motion and manipulates the LED and piezo. My next step will be to add the code needed to play audio from the SD card through a speaker. I suspect once I have that software mod working I will have to design more amplification than the Audio shield provides.</p>\n\n<p>As far as applications for this project: well, you&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit to hear about that. I&rsquo;m planning to create a few postings on the Arduino resources I&rsquo;ve found most useful. The photo below shows the current build with the Audio shield stacked on top of the Arduino Duo with a small breadboard for the misc parts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ronguest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Arduino-with-Audio-Shield.jpg\"></a></p>\n",

But it's another market segment I don't belong to.\n\nHere's hoping the next generation iPad is compelling enough to make me pull  the trigger on a purchase. I think a front facing camera is about all it will take :-)\n\n<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/guides/2010/10/116-macbook-air-ars-answers-your-burning-questions.ars\" target=\"_blank\">Via arstechnica</a>:<img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"MacBook Air is Sexy\" src=\"http://ronguest.net/uploads/2018/377ff9b1d8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" />\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The title of this post will likely warm your heart, if you&rsquo;re an Apple fan, or irritate the heck out of you if you&rsquo;re neutral or a hater. Still, I write on and if you can stomach it read on because the ending may surprise you :-)</p>\n\n<p>I first want to point out this isn&rsquo;t my first dip-of-the-toe in the waters of alternative entertainment distribution (i.e. non-cable/satellite). For about a year now I&rsquo;ve experimented with a whole range of solutions having variously run Plex, Boxee, XBMC and some homegrown &ldquo;media centers&rdquo; on a computer connected to our main HDTV. All of these prior solutions failed, based on my criteria, as they didn&rsquo;t meet the meets-min usability for our family - namely to be friendly, easy to use, and bulletproof for my 6 year old and preferably even for my 2 year old. Several of the media center solutions even failed the test for me, a tech geek, as they were too unstable or required too much administrative overhead in order to see the real benefit. I&rsquo;m convinced most of these solutions are for the sort of guy or gal who would buy an old Alfa Romeo. You simply have to love working on it in order to find it a good experience.</p>\n\n<p>Enter the new AppleTV. I rarely buy the first generation of a new Apple product - still don&rsquo;t own an iPad, took me a couple years to decide an iPhone was worth it, and so on. And make no mistake - this new AppleTV shares nothing but a name with the &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; version and is indeed a first generation product. Yet as soon as the announcement of the new AppleTV was out I immediately entered a pre-order and started preparing for it by relocating the media center computer, picking up an extra HDMI cable, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So I was ready to plug the AppleTV into our system the moment it arrived. My first impression was how small it is, second was how cool the combination of matte and glossy black finish looked. As always Apple showed design chops even though the AppleTV will generally be hidden once installed. In my case I plugged in an Ethernet cable (Gigabit), an HDMI cable and the power and I was immediately greeted by a very slick and clean UI. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like during the setup phase, <del datetime=\"2010-10-04T15:32:07+00:00\">and have to imagine Apple will soon address</del> and Apple has already addressed, is the fact entering user names and passwords (for accounts like Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, etc.) is very tedious. Tons of scrolling and clicking. The same day the AppleTV arrived Apple released an update to the iPhone/iPad Remote application enabling you to do your typing on the virtual keyboard. Very nice! Here&rsquo;s a summary of my opinion - read on for the gory details.</p>\n\n<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_87&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;642&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;The Good and the Bad&rdquo;][/caption]</p>\n\n<p>The most striking aspect of the AppleTV has been it&rsquo;s stability. The family has used it for hours and we have yet to see a streaming glitch or UI problem. I presume the device is using it&rsquo;s hefty amount of RAM to do unusually large buffering. Performance of Netflix streaming to the AppleTV is definitely more reliable than to any of the computers connected to the same network (which use Flash and Silverlight I believe). YouTube streaming works equally well.</p>\n\n<p>iTunes rentals are pretty convenient but be warned it asks for the CVV code on the back of your credit card. For adults I think that is a fine solution. But to allow kiddos to rent content, if you&rsquo;re a trusting parent, a user-settable code would be preferable.</p>\n\n<p>iTunes rental image quality is outstanding at 720p. Yeah, our set is 1080p and so it isn&rsquo;t quite as good as we could get with a directly connected 1080p source. But at 720p the image quality is superior to nearly all cable and satellite distributed content and is superior to the Roku based on the comparisons I&rsquo;ve seen. Playing a rented iTunes movie and comparing it to the same movie streamed by Netflix really highlights the inferior technology Netflix uses even over a solid network connection. Of course for the price of two average iTunes movie rentals you get to stream all the Netflix content you can handle for a month&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also using the AppleTV to stream content from our own library stored on a Mac Mini used as a server. We have DVDs, family movies, TV shows and a large photo library (used as our screensaver). Getting this to work is brain-dead simple since you only need to turn on Home Sharing on the AppleTV and computer to make this happen. I did notice, however, that the AppleTV does not see iTunes media on our NAS which uses Firefly. Home Sharing is apparently required and at least for now that is a closed protocol.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I think about this $99 purchase? For this family of 4 (mom, dad, and children 6 and 2 years old) it is a great addition. It is immediately usable with no training required even for the 6 year old. It seems bulletproof. It successfully delivers the content we care about and, with the Remote app, even searching of contacts and content is a breeze. But in the end <strong>this review isn&rsquo;t</strong> particularly <strong>about the AppleTV</strong> - it&rsquo;s about the Revolution in content distribution. For the first time it is obvious that the technology needed to divorce ourselves from the communistic content control of the cable and satellite companies is ready for the mainstream. I&rsquo;ve seen a few people slam the AppleTV as being &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo; so only suitable for &ldquo;mom&rdquo; or &ldquo;grandma&rdquo;. Frankly, that is the point of a  revolution - it must be populist and hence meaningful and beneficial to masses. Apple has proved it is doable. I&rsquo;m sure Google and the typical cast of characters will follow suit. Well, except Microsoft. They can never get anything right for consumers.</p>\n",

You simply have to love working on it in order to find it a good experience.\n\nEnter the new AppleTV. I rarely buy the first generation of a new Apple product - still don't own an iPad, took me a couple years to decide an iPhone was worth it, and so on. And make no mistake - this new AppleTV shares nothing but a name with the \"hobby\" version and is indeed a first generation product. Yet as soon as the announcement of the new AppleTV was out I immediately entered a pre-order and started preparing for it by relocating the media center computer, picking up an extra HDMI cable, and so on.\n\nSo I was ready to plug the AppleTV into our system the moment it arrived. My first impression was how small it is, second was how cool the combination of matte and glossy black finish looked. As always Apple showed design chops even though the AppleTV will generally be hidden once installed. In my case I plugged in an Ethernet cable (Gigabit), an HDMI cable and the power and I was immediately greeted by a very slick and clean UI. The only thing I didn't like during the setup phase, <del datetime=\"2010-10-04T15:32:07+00:00\">and have to imagine Apple will soon address</del> and Apple has already addressed, is the fact entering user names and passwords (for accounts like Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, etc.) is very tedious. Tons of scrolling and clicking. The same day the AppleTV arrived Apple released an update to the iPhone/iPad Remote application enabling you to do your typing on the virtual keyboard. Very nice! Here's a summary of my opinion - read on for the gory details.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_87\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"642\" caption=\"The Good and the Bad\"][/caption]\n\nThe most striking aspect of the AppleTV has been it's stability. The family has used it for hours and we have yet to see a streaming glitch or UI problem. I presume the device is using it's hefty amount of RAM to do unusually large buffering. Performance of Netflix streaming to the AppleTV is definitely more reliable than to any of the computers connected to the same network (which use Flash and Silverlight I believe). YouTube streaming works equally well.\n\niTunes rentals are pretty convenient but be warned it asks for the CVV code on the back of your credit card. For adults I think that is a fine solution. But to allow kiddos to rent content, if you're a trusting parent, a user-settable code would be preferable.\n\niTunes rental image quality is outstanding at 720p. Yeah, our set is 1080p and so it isn't quite as good as we could get with a directly connected 1080p source. But at 720p the image quality is superior to nearly all cable and satellite distributed content and is superior to the Roku based on the comparisons I've seen. Playing a rented iTunes movie and comparing it to the same movie streamed by Netflix really highlights the inferior technology Netflix uses even over a solid network connection. Of course for the price of two average iTunes movie rentals you get to stream all the Netflix content you can handle for a month...\n\nWe're also using the AppleTV to stream content from our own library stored on a Mac Mini used as a server. We have DVDs, family movies, TV shows and a large photo library (used as our screensaver). Getting this to work is brain-dead simple since you only need to turn on Home Sharing on the AppleTV and computer to make this happen. I did notice, however, that the AppleTV does not see iTunes media on our NAS which uses Firefly. Home Sharing is apparently required and at least for now that is a closed protocol.\n\nSo what do I think about this $99 purchase? For this family of 4 (mom, dad, and children 6 and 2 years old) it is a great addition. It is immediately usable with no training required even for the 6 year old. It seems bulletproof. It successfully delivers the content we care about and, with the Remote app, even searching of contacts and content is a breeze. But in the end <strong>this review isn't</strong> particularly <strong>about the AppleTV</strong> - it's about the Revolution in content distribution. For the first time it is obvious that the technology needed to divorce ourselves from the communistic content control of the cable and satellite companies is ready for the mainstream. I've seen a few people slam the AppleTV as being \"handicapped\" so only suitable for \"mom\" or \"grandma\". Frankly, that is the point of a  revolution - it must be populist and hence meaningful and beneficial to masses. Apple has proved it is doable. I'm sure Google and the typical cast of characters will follow suit. Well, except Microsoft. They can never get anything right for consumers.\n",
