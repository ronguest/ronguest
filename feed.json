There also isn‚Äôt much evidence that this age group is a key spreader of the virus. Maybe it would be best to wait?</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôve made him an appointment for a vaccine on Monday and I believe we will proceed with his vaccination. Certainly doing so benefits the community since it eliminates him as a potential spreader. At the moment I feel the benefits-risks for our son is pretty much a push: a small risk of a heart problem which will probably be temporary and minor versus the small risk of a bad Covid infection leading to longer term complications. My decision is partly influenced by the most recent data showing males 16 and over are more at risk of the heart complications. </p>\n",

Some, like Advil and allergy meds, were long shelf life items. Others like milk and bread were items we wanted to keep an eye on to ensure we didn&rsquo;t let ourselves get too low in case of panic buying or closures.<br />\nMar 1: I used the end of Feb to assess the market&rsquo;s crash on our Net Worth. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t positive but neither was it large enough to be worrisome.<br />\nMar 3: Made a trip to CVS for Kleenex, Advil etc as the outbreak in the US spread<br />\nMar 5: Asked myself if we should get out during our spring break to go to an arcade or something and my answer at the time was &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.<br />\nMar 9: Made note of the oil price war started by Saudi Arabia and Russia and it&rsquo;s effect on investments<br />\nMar 10: Our daughter went to the mall with her best friend as well as a movie to celebrate the friend&rsquo;s birthday. We weren&rsquo;t really concerned about it.<br />\nMar 11: I went with my wife to the grocery store to do a bit of stocking up. No shortages and no one seemed worried.<br />\nMar 12: School&rsquo;s announce they will be closed. Thought about selling more assets to cash but it didn&rsquo;t feel warranted.

Meat was running a bit low as well as certain fruit. My wife checked our freezer and decided with &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; orders looming we should pick up some more meat so we made another trip to the grocery store. By this time of day people were a bit frantic.<br />\nMar 18: School closure announced the rest of this month and home learning announced in its place. I took my son to his dentist appointment and our dentist told me they were closing starting Friday.<br />\nMar 20: Markets seemed to be stabilizing. Cases in our county and the area still very low<br />\nMar 21: I implemented our budget cuts and updated our financial plan accordingly. With great reluctance we agreed our teenage daughter could have one of her best friends over in lieu of birthday activities we had to cancel due to the virus.<br />\nMar 22: Sold some more assets in a taxable account. At least that brings a capital loss against taxes for the future.<br />\nMar 25: Came up with a plan to re-invest in the markets as the worst was starting to feel over. Took the first tiny step in doing so. The market is changing faster than I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<br />\nMar 26: Took note of the fact I expected the virus to pass long before its economic impact does.<br />\nMar 27: Went to the grocery store when they opened. Much busier than normal and a lot of basics were gone.<br />\nMar 29: We took another drive in the country. This time the little towns looked pretty deserted.<br />\nMar 30: Bought a little more stock and sold bonds<br />\nMar 31: I dug out my woodworking masks just in case&hellip; Government project 100K-240K deaths. Schools to stay closed for all of April.<br />\nApr 1: Cases in our county have leapt up including hospitalizations. Of course nothing like NYC. Market has a bad day.<br />\nApr 2: I went to the grocery store when they opened. There was a line of people waiting to get inside.<br />\nApr 3: My wife starts making cloth face masks<br />\nApr 5: I noted I had let my exercise fall away. But also that there was a hint of optimism in the air for the first time.<br />\nApr 6: With some encouraging data from NY I bought equities again. I had a sore throat which worried me&hellip;<br />\nApr 7: Sore throat gone.<br />\nApr 8: Customers at grocery store nearly all wearing masks.<br />\nApr 9: Finished plan for re-investing my cash and made more equity purchases<br />\nApr 11: Our investments have recovered enough I could rollback some of our planned budget cuts.<br />\nApr 12: Easter. It just didn&rsquo;t feel like Easter for us.<br />\nApr 14: Virus cases here have clearly leveled off. Hospital beds and ICUs are only about 50% occupied. Hospitals complain about all the lost revenue from treating heart patients, cancer and so on. My wife gives me permission to get a sandwich from my fave take out place.<br />\nApr 15: Bought some bonds. Our portfolio allocation is make to it&rsquo;s long term target.

With great reluctance we agreed our teenage daughter could have one of her best friends over in lieu of birthday activities we had to cancel due to the virus.  \nMar 22: Sold some more assets in a taxable account. At least that brings a capital loss against taxes for the future.  \nMar 25: Came up with a plan to re-invest in the markets as the worst was starting to feel over. Took the first tiny step in doing so. The market is changing faster than I've ever seen before.  \nMar 26: Took note of the fact I expected the virus to pass long before its economic impact does.  \nMar 27: Went to the grocery store when they opened. Much busier than normal and a lot of basics were gone.  \nMar 29: We took another drive in the country. This time the little towns looked pretty deserted.   \nMar 30: Bought a little more stock and sold bonds  \nMar 31: I dug out my woodworking masks just in case... Government project 100K-240K deaths. Schools to stay closed for all of April.  \nApr 1: Cases in our county have leapt up including hospitalizations. Of course nothing like NYC. Market has a bad day.  \nApr 2: I went to the grocery store when they opened. There was a line of people waiting to get inside.  \nApr 3: My wife starts making cloth face masks  \nApr 5: I noted I had let my exercise fall away. But also that there was a hint of optimism in the air for the first time.  \nApr 6: With some encouraging data from NY I bought equities again. I had a sore throat which worried me...  \nApr 7: Sore throat gone.   \nApr 8: Customers at grocery store nearly all wearing masks.  \nApr 9: Finished plan for re-investing my cash and made more equity purchases  \nApr 11: Our investments have recovered enough I could rollback some of our planned budget cuts.  \nApr 12: Easter. It just didn't feel like Easter for us.  \nApr 14: Virus cases here have clearly leveled off. Hospital beds and ICUs are only about 50% occupied. Hospitals complain about all the lost revenue from treating heart patients, cancer and so on. My wife gives me permission to get a sandwich from my fave take out place.  \nApr 15: Bought some bonds. Our portfolio allocation is make to it's long term target. Never would have expected to get back so fast.   \n\n...More to come of course...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So today I borrowed a different keyboard to try and the same thing happens. After doing some research at the Foundation‚Äôs site it turns out there are a lot of reports of this. The RPi 4 has trouble with Bluetooth keyboards when used simultaneously with WiFi. Since June of last year. Because, you know, nobody uses those two things together.</p>\n\n<p>Solution: Don‚Äôt do that.</p>\n\n<p>Either use a USB keyboard or only use Ethernet.

So today I borrowed a different keyboard to try and the same thing happens. After doing some research at the Foundation‚Äôs site it turns out there are a lot of reports of this. The RPi 4 has trouble with Bluetooth keyboards when used simultaneously with WiFi. Since June of last year. Because, you know, nobody uses those two things together.\n\nSolution: Don‚Äôt do that.\n\nEither use a USB keyboard or only use Ethernet.

				"content_html": "<p>For several years I&rsquo;ve done those things people say you should to track and manage diet and exercise/fitness. For over a year I logged everything I ate in MyFitnessPal, logged my weight daily, and used my iPhone/Apple Watch to track standing, movement and exercise. Each was helpful, at least in short bursts, but after each of my pushes the outcome was pretty disappointing. Flaws, to me, include the information being disjointed across these apps even though I could pull it all into the Health app on my iPhone. The data was just that - a bunch for data with a limited clue as to compliance and history. It was hard to see trends and to see how these different aspects of my life interacted. And MyFitnessPal (and it&rsquo;s ilk) are really tedious to do for any length of time. I also tried using automated tools in apps like Things and Day One to have me keep track myself and those didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stick&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t satisfy my complaints either.</p>\n\n<p>Since I wasn&rsquo;t happy with where I was health-wise and didn&rsquo;t feel like these tools were working for me I decided to take a different approach. And, once again proving I&rsquo;m a nerd, I decided a spreadsheet would better allow me to document my activity and dietary goals for each day and then to track compliance. So about a month ago I created a spreadsheet table with a column for each day and 4 rows of activities and 7 rows of dietary objectives. Even though it is a spreadsheet the cells are simply checkboxes. When I am compliance for the row I check off the box. Some items are positives like getting in my aerobic exercise for the day and others are negatives such as not eating a carb snack in the morning. The bottom row of the spreadsheet totals up the check marked cells. Achieving 7 is the bare minimum and earns a yellow status while 8 or more is good compliance and is a green status. I can quickly open and update the day&rsquo;s status on any device and in doing so also get a reminder of what I am supposed to be doing and how today compares to previous days.</p>\n\n<p>So far I&rsquo;m really happy with this approach - it suits my style and personality quite well. Below is a an example of a one week snapshot. Wednesday&rsquo;s is colored green because that was Christmas Day and I made that a complete cheat day. Friday and Saturday&rsquo;s compliance is poor due to a road trip (noted in a comment on Friday). Monday (today as I draft this post) hasn&rsquo;t yet met the objective (but there&rsquo;s still time!). And Tuesday is blank because it isn&rsquo;t Tuesday yet. Fortunately my compliance was better leading up to Christmas week!</p>\n\n<p>The actual spreadsheet has more personal details about my objectives as well as having one tab for each month and one column for every day of the month.</p>\n\n<p>N.B. I still use and value Apple&rsquo;s health related apps for tracking the details and for it&rsquo;s gamification of compliance but overall this spreadsheet is now the key for me. Also I considered making some items in the spreadsheet worth more than others. But I elected to keep it simple and also stay conscious of the fact that the core purpose was to come close to 100% compliance each day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://ronguest.net/uploads/2019/6efab1b859.png\" width=\"373\" height=\"265\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

So I grabbed my iPad and used that - twice - and after restarting the ATV I finally got that to work. But still no joy on the remote.

Sometimes it works like magic but 50% of the time it doesn't activate. It makes me feel awkward and self conscious when I talk to my watch and absolutely nothing happens. I have not figure out why. OK, the rest is positives...</li>\n<ul>\n    <li>Well, there is one other thing that really bothers me though I knew about it ahead of time: The Watch should be able to stream music to my car's Bluetooth. Inability to do this is a major chink in the \"ok to leave your phone at home\" concept.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n    <li>Size: I went from the 42mm to the 44mm and was a bit worried about the size since my wrist is on a bit small. But the 4mm looks ok on me and feels smaller and lighter than the old 42mm.</li>\n    <li>Appearance: When the iPhone X came out I didn't plan to do an upgrade. But while having a battery replaced at an Apple Store I gave it a look and a feel (!) and instantly wanted to upgrade. The Series 4 doesn't have the same impact but it definitely looks better than the Series 0 and has something of the look of the iPhone X.</li>\n    <li>Display: Really bright, very clear, and functionally seems much larger than the physical increase would indicate. I turned text size down to the smallest setting.</li>\n    <li>Water: I like to listen to music when I shower and it was always annoying to be in there when songs came on I wasn't in the mood to listen to. I wear the Series 4 whenever I shower and I can use both touch and voice to control my music. This is pure joy for me.</li>\n    <li>Infographs: I am using both of the Infograph faces. I have a Modular face set up for weekends and the other set up for weekdays because I have a different focus on those days. I welcome the addition of these new faces but I like symmetry and some of the complications around the edge have one design (e.g. arced with a color gradient) and others have a clashing design (circular). It took me quite awhile to come up with complications for each corner that didn't feel off balance. I'm only using 2 of the sub-dial slots (top and bottom, left and right are empty). Aside: for some reason the AQI complication often fails to display any data even though the UV complication always works.</li>\n    <li>Sleep: I now sleep with my watch on. Partly because I am using AutoSleep to track my sleep pattern and quality and partly because I hate having to unlock my watch when I first wake up. It's great to be able to give Siri commands via my watch as soon as I get up (my iPhone sleeps in my office, not my bedroom). And AutoSleep works well.</li>\n    <li>Battery: I've had the watch a couple of weeks and I have never gotten it charged to 100% since I'm sleeping with the watch on. I usually charge the watch a couple of hours in the evening and with that the battery hasn't dropped below 18%.</li>\n    <li>Performance: It's great. Don't know what else to say about it.</li>\n    <li>Wallet: My Series 0 wasn't responsive enough to ever use the wallet/Apple Pay. I would always feel like a nerd when I tried and then it would fail in a shop full of people. The Series 4 works perfectly so I use the Wallet several times a week.</li>\n    <li>Connectivity: With all the options in Series 4 with cellular it has naturally been quite good. But it's only a 4/5 stars so far. Normally it will operate just fine if my iPhone is far away within the house or I leave it at home. But occasionally the watch seems to spend quite a bit of time figuring out it can't talk to the iPhone and needs to switch to WiFi or cellular as appropriate. The delay can be on the order of 10 seconds which is more than enough to be highly annoying. I'd rather it err on being more aggressive in connecting on it's own.</li>\n    <li>Health: Sometimes it would take me more than a minute on my Series 0 watch to start a workout. It was incredibly frustrating to have it lock up while trying to do so. Naturally it works perfectly now. The heart info feeds into AutoSleep and my workouts but I have no known heart issues so I can't speak to the other features. Also, I haven't fallen...</li>\n    <li>CARROT: I'm a long time fan of the app and on the Series 4 it is a delight. I paid for the upgrade so I can use it's complications on my watch faces.</li>\n    <li>1Password: I sync a few credit cards, library card and my drivers' license info. Essentially this is \"I forgot my wallet\" mode.</li>\n    <li>Radarscope: Because it's cool to have a weather radar on your wrist! It works well on a Series 4.</li>\n    <li>Apps: I do have 24 apps installed but other than those noted above nothing else is particularly remarkable (e.g. Yelp, Hilton).</li>\n</ul>\n",

I had played with <a href=\"http://www.plex.tv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plex Media Server</a> a bit on the iMac and when I saw there was a Plex package for Synology I set that up in what amounted to a single click. A bonus is that Plex on the Synology supports hardware accelerated transcoding of videos. Moving the media files from the iMac to the NAS was painless [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]but time consuming[/footnote]. Getting the media files named in a way that Plex would handle correctly was a big pain in the ass because it works completely differently than iTunes[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]maybe I&rsquo;ll post about that some day[/footnote]. Once I discovered and ran some tools to help with the media naming transition Plex proved to be an awesome media server. Much more reliable than iTunes. So at this stage my little box became a combination of NAS + NVR + <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_server\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HTPC</a>¬†and I was filling up the empty bays with additional disks.

I heard of a package called <a href=\"https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HomeBridge</a> which, when running 24/7, added HomeKit support for WeMo. I initially rejected the idea of installing this home-brew package on the NAS since I considered the NAS &ldquo;mission critical&rdquo; for our household. That was until I heard it was possible to run HomeBridge in a¬†<a href=\"https://www.docker.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Docker</a>¬†container[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]Docker is a great piece of IT infrastructure software that makes it easy to run images on top of host OS such as Windows, Linux and MacOS [/footnote]. Installing Docker was quick and easy. Installing HomeBridge was easy as well but configuring it properly was tricky and required quite a bit of trial and error. However once configured HomeBridge provided trouble-free integration of our WeMo devices [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I could now use Siri to open and close my garage door[/footnote]. Time to add one more duty for my little NAS box: now we&rsquo;ve got a 4 headed Hydra with NAS + NVR + HTPC + <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Virtualization Server</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Docker containers are like potato chips: no one can eat just one.

The great thing is that if one of those crashes it has no effect on the mission critical uses of the NAS [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]and the container will automatically be restarted[/footnote]. I recently began running Apache on the NAS to serve up files formerly hosted on my <a href=\"http://digitalocean.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Digital Ocean</a> VPS [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]these are consumed by IoT custom devices at home and accessing them became problematic when I further locked down my VPS[/footnote].

				"title": "My about face on Live Photos; also thanks Snapthread!",
				"content_html": "<p>When Apple first introduced Live photos I thought they were just a gimmick - a bit of flash for some marketing buzz. After all, almost no one but the owner would ever see the live version, right? Fast forward a couple of years and I needed a new phone and after holding one at an Apple store I splurged for an iPhone X for Christmas.  A couple days later we leave for a vacation and it happens‚Ä¶ a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion. Why you may ask?</p>\n\n<p>Live Photos are an amazing way to capture the <strong>perfect</strong> moment when photographing an individual or group. Remember how often someone&rsquo;s expression is just slightly off, or they have just started to blink and their eyes aren&rsquo;t completely open? Live Photos capture a few seconds in time and based on taking a few hundred photos on the trip are amazingly effective at capturing those ‚Äújust right‚Äù expressions. All you need to do is scan through each frame of the Live Photo and pick the right key frame.</p>\n\n<p>I also discovered another thing about Live Photos. There can be a lot of humor captured in those few seconds as people start to mug for the camera or relax just after they think the photo is done. I found value in Live Photos even in landscape photos (e.g. at the beach). Those few seconds are often the prefect amount of time to capture a wave crashing on the beach or trees rustling in a forest - without the hassle of starting and stopping a movie capture. It just seems more natural and it really encourages short snippets of motion. At least for me, I always hated to fire up the video mode unless I was recording something that took awhile. It all sounds great, right, <strong>but</strong> ‚Ä¶</p>\n\n<p>Apple in one of those odd decisions it makes provides no way to really leverage and share the motion captured in Live Photos.

She kindly agreed to add me as a beta tester and at first I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could pull off my project with the app. I feared I was still going to have to jump through the hoops to get them all into iMovie - not something I looked forward to at all. But I made a few suggestions to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/becky\">@becky</a> which she implemented virtually over night and viola I had the perfect iOS app for creating videos out of stitched together Live Photos. In fact Snapthread worked so well I integrated some movies taken from the trip with the Live Photos. When it was all said and done I and created 48 clips in Snapthread (from a few seconds to a few minutes)!

Thank you Becky!

Arduino processors have very little memory so the SD card is essential to play sounds of any complexity or duration.</p>\n\n<p>My current software manages the Infrared sensor, lights a LED when motion is detected and also plays a tone on a piezo device. The Audio shield has pretty low level hardware so the software to manipulate it is relatively complex and will take a little time to integrate. I built the Audio shield last night and tonight I integrated it with the PIR, LED and piezo and tweaked the software that senses motion and manipulates the LED and piezo. My next step will be to add the code needed to play audio from the SD card through a speaker. I suspect once I have that software mod working I will have to design more amplification than the Audio shield provides.</p>\n\n<p>As far as applications for this project: well, you&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit to hear about that. I&rsquo;m planning to create a few postings on the Arduino resources I&rsquo;ve found most useful.

				"content_html": "<p>I heard a debate last week over an analyst&rsquo;s claim that the iPad was cannibalizing sales of not just netbooks but also a whole range of consumer electronics devices - including TVs. I don&rsquo;t put much credence in that claim but it did kick off a train of thought and it didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize my iPhone actually <strong>had</strong> saved me money (or in analyst speak cannibalized sales of other devices).

With my old iPhone 3G I would have pulled the trigger before the holiday season. But the iPhone 4&rsquo;s camera is a big improvement, and is superior to the SD450, plus has the huge benefit of satisfying the adage that &ldquo;the best camera is the one you have with you.&rdquo; <strong>Savings: $400</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">The second purchase I&rsquo;ve avoided is a new laptop. My Titanium PowerBook is 7 years old and although it still works like a charm it is so hopelessly out-of-date as to be useless. It can&rsquo;t even join my wireless network since it doesn&rsquo;t support WPA. The OS is terribly backwards as well. Lacks FW800 and USB2 ports. Dot dot dot. I have a Windows laptop from my employer but I&rsquo;m a stickler for not putting personal info on it or using it for personal tasks. So a refurbished MacBook Pro was on my list for use when traveling or just away from home for awhile. Although the iPhone can&rsquo;t do everything I&rsquo;d expect the laptop to do it comes close enough that I no longer have a MacBook on my shopping list. <strong>Savings: $1,000</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000\">My family really <strong>loves</strong> its music and we want it <strong>now</strong> and we want it <strong>here</strong> (here being wherever we are at home, including our home gym, or when running errands etc). Of course we all know the iPhone is an excellent iPod but also when combined with iTunes and the little Airport Express it provides a great whole-home audio streamer synced with our playlists. You can thank Airplay and Home Sharing for this. Just download the iPhone <em>Remote</em> app and you can pipe your music to one room or the whole house complete with visual playlists, album art and more. As a bonus you can stream to the new AppleTV as well. No need for an expensive one-trick-pony solution like Sonos. <strong>Savings: $500+</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>Finally, lest you think Apple is completely benefiting from this train of thought, I have not purchased an iPad. Like a laptop, the iPad can be used in ways the iPhone can&rsquo;t.

Several of the media center solutions even failed the test for me, a tech geek, as they were too unstable or required too much administrative overhead in order to see the real benefit.

And make no mistake - this new AppleTV shares nothing but a name with the &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; version and is indeed a first generation product.¬†Yet as soon as the announcement of the new AppleTV was out I immediately entered a pre-order and started preparing for it by relocating the media center computer, picking up an extra HDMI cable, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So I was ready to plug the AppleTV into our system the moment it arrived. My first impression was how small it is, second was how cool the combination of matte and glossy black finish looked. As always Apple showed design chops even though the AppleTV will generally be hidden once installed.

Yeah, our set is 1080p and so it isn&rsquo;t quite as good as we could get with a directly connected 1080p source. But at 720p the image quality is superior to nearly all cable and satellite distributed content and is superior to the Roku based on the comparisons I&rsquo;ve seen. Playing a rented iTunes movie and comparing it to the same movie streamed by Netflix really highlights the inferior technology Netflix uses even over a solid network connection. Of course for the price of two average iTunes movie rentals you get to stream all the Netflix content you can handle for a month&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;re also using the AppleTV to stream content from our own library stored on a Mac Mini used as a server.

It successfully delivers the content we care about and, with the Remote app, even searching of contacts and content is a breeze. But in the end <strong>this review isn&rsquo;t</strong> particularly <strong>about the AppleTV</strong> - it&rsquo;s about the Revolution in content distribution. For the first time it is obvious that the technology needed to divorce ourselves from the communistic content control of the cable and satellite companies is ready for the mainstream. I&rsquo;ve seen a few people slam the AppleTV as being &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo; so only suitable for &ldquo;mom&rdquo; or &ldquo;grandma&rdquo;. Frankly, that is the point of a ¬†revolution - it must be populist and hence meaningful and beneficial to masses. Apple has proved it is doable. I&rsquo;m sure Google and the typical cast of characters will follow suit. Well, except Microsoft. They can never get anything right for consumers.</p>\n",

For the first time it is obvious that the technology needed to divorce ourselves from the communistic content control of the cable and satellite companies is ready for the mainstream. I've seen a few people slam the AppleTV as being \"handicapped\" so only suitable for \"mom\" or \"grandma\". Frankly, that is the point of a ¬†revolution - it must be populist and hence meaningful and beneficial to masses. Apple has proved it is doable. I'm sure Google and the typical cast of characters will follow suit. Well, except Microsoft. They can never get anything right for consumers.\n",

I had earlier done some upstairs prep work, namely installing a UPS, power strip and Ethernet cable. Completing the Mini&rsquo;s relocation took a bit longer than expected since there was an issue with the cat 5e cable.
