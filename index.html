			 <p>I‚Äôve been on mastodon 4 years. At first it felt ‚Äúmeh‚Äù but I dove in again a couple months ago and, especially after moving to fosstodon, find it engaging and I love being able to moderate my own timeline (mutes, filters, blocks and so on). It also feels better for microblogging and I don‚Äôt have to rely on someone else moderating.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve made the switch to <a href="www.arqbackup.com">Arq Backup</a> for all devices (Mac, Windows, NAS, and Raspberry Pi) and all 3-2-1 destinations (Local NAS, Cloud and Offline Disk). I‚Äôm really pleased to have one backup tool ‚Äúto rule them all‚Äù.</p>

<p>I started using Arq 5 a couple of years ago to do low-cost offsite backups to Amazon‚Äôs AWS Glacier storage. It was much cheaper than a service like Backblaze since I needed to run on multiple computers. Over that time period Arq proved to be stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Recently I moved some data-oriented workloads from my NAS to Raspberry Pi‚Äôs. This triggered a look at how to include Pi‚Äôs in my backup plans and, one thing leading to another as it does, I reviewed my whole backup strategy. As I started documenting my goals for backups and the possible tools/solutions I could use I saw how Arq‚Äôs v7 backup tool could greatly simplify my life (well my backup life at least).</p>

<p>Arq‚Äôs software can backup to a crap-ton (technical word) of online services including Amazon Drive, AWS, Backblaze B2, Dropbox and OneDrive to name a few. Arq can also backup to local HD/SSD as well as NAS devices. When I set up AWS Glacier a couple of years ago it was a bit daunting and I have to admit I‚Äôve found monitoring AWS usage to be rather opaque.</p>

<p>To advance my effort to simplify backups I decided to adopt Arq Premium which includes two key features in the annual fee: a license good for 5 computers and a very easy to use 1 TB of their own cloud storage (additional costs charged at a reasonable amount per GB). N.B. They also offer their software on a license basis without an annual fee with no Cloud storage included i.e. a ‚Äúbring your own storage‚Äù approach.</p>

<p>From a design standpoint I decided to make my iMac the primary hub. In addition to running its own 3‚Äì2-1 backups it backs up the Raspberry Pi‚Äôs as well as selected portions of my NAS using Arq tasks that automatically mount those devices‚Äô drives. The other Macs and Window devices independently run their own 3-2-1 backups using Arq.</p>

<p>Setting up the Arq tasks was straightforward. Over the course of my research and implementation I contacted support with questions and she very responsive and accurate in her answers. Since I never include operating system files or applications I was pleased with how much fit within the 1TB included storage amount even though my backups do include a large library of photos as well as our movie library. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll ever need more than 1TB in spite of backing up the key data from multiple devices. I think Arq‚Äôs de-dup and compression algorithms work well.</p>

<p>Overall I feel I made the right decision. If I didn‚Äôt already have a few years experience with Arq 5 I probably would have taken a slower approach. But jumping in with both feet feels right and the result is more reliable backups and more convenience for me in checking on status.</p>

			 <p>In preparation for the first ever Federal Fusion Center activation to test large-scale disaster communications I buckled down and finally got Winlink running over HF with my Icom IC-7300.I‚Äôm feeling quite accomplished.</p>

<p>In simple terms Winlink enables sending and receiving email using HF radio frequencies rather than an internet connection. This is a common emergency communication method when cell service and the internet are down during disasters. There are a number of forms for transmission that are tailored to specific disaster recovery needs and most users have some degree of FEMA training.</p>

<p>Winlink isn‚Äôt the most user friendly piece of software, HF communication is always tricky and radio interfaces can be as well. I had the added challenge that Winlink is Windows-only for EMCOMM and I‚Äôm a Mac user. After shooting myself in the foot a few times I did manage to get it all working using Parallels.</p>

<p>Our ARES group is one of the first in the country to participate so there is a big push to ensure success this weekend. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôll be able to contribute using a ‚Äòdisaster mode‚Äô setup.</p>

<p>Background info: The Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) (Formally known as the Office of Emergency Communications) has recently created a Federal level Fusion center.  The mission of the Fusion Center is to staff a coordinating center to process requests for Amateur assistance, at a Federal level, during large-scale disasters. It will bring together various Amateur organizations, including ARES /RACES, Civil Air Patrol, ARC, Salvation Army, REACT, and the VOIP Hurricane Net. CISA will request the Fusion Center‚Äôs activation.</p>

			 <p>Our son is 12 years old so meets the minimum age for the Pfizer vaccine (approved for 12 and up). The rest of us, all older, have completed our vaccines. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve been hesitating this week regarding his vaccination. There have been amplified reports of a statistically significant rise in myocarditis and pericarditis in vaccinated adolescents and young adults. Especially in males. These are potentially life threatening side effects and are occurring with both Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p>

<p>Given a healthy 12 year old boy is unlikely to have a severe case of Covid the decision isn‚Äôt the no-brainer it was for the rest of the family. There also isn‚Äôt much evidence that this age group is a key spreader of the virus. Maybe it would be best to wait?</p>

<p>I‚Äôve made him an appointment for a vaccine on Monday and I believe we will proceed with his vaccination. Certainly doing so benefits the community since it eliminates him as a potential spreader. At the moment I feel the benefits-risks for our son is pretty much a push: a small risk of a heart problem which will probably be temporary and minor versus the small risk of a bad Covid infection leading to longer term complications. My decision is partly influenced by the most recent data showing males 16 and over are more at risk of the heart complications. </p>

			 <p>Our HS junior daughter had told me the at-home learners were holding back progress of the in-person students as teachers tried to keep the cohorts on the same pace. Which was failing. Today the district notified us at-home learners with poor grades or absenteeism will be forced to the in-person option for the rest of the academic year. Fortunately our in-person kids are doing great. From what I hear the poor performance of at-home learners is widespread.</p>

			 <p>The school district let us know yesterday morning that parents will be able to opt for traditional at-school learning or a home learning program this fall. I think for planning purposes they're trying to get a feel for how many people already know they will opt for the home option.</p>

<p>We strongly believe attendance at school is best for both of our kids. The district assured us that unlike this past spring, at-home learning will have full rigor, content and better access to interactive sessions. That's good to hear but I still don't think it will be as beneficial for the kids.</p>

<p>Of course the decision has a context which is Covid. Although local hospitalization rates and fatalities have not spiked, cases are edging up. I'm sure some parents already know they will opt for the safer option of at-home learning. But it will be a devil of a choice for parents of special needs kids and those whose home situation makes learning very difficult.</p>

<p>Even for us I don't know which way we will go just yet. What data should we base our decision on and which thresholds are 'safe enough'?</p>

<p>If Covid gets worse then there won't be a decision at all, we'll have to go with home learning either to start the year or as we enter winter.</p>

I got an extra <a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/wireless_mini_switch.html">wireless mini switch</a> and have it setup to trigger one of 3 different playlists on my HomePods.

			 <p>I see a lot of people counting on a vaccine to dramatically reduce the threat of COVID-19 and helping re-open "life" within a year. I think that is a false hope. It is going to take several years to get an effective vaccine deployed worldwide. It could take even longer if the virus mutates regularly. Look how long we've spent working on flu vaccines and they still haven't been perfected yielding widely varying effectiveness from year to year. It is scientifically possible there will never be a highly effective vaccine.</p>

<p>I hang my hat more on developing effective treatment and better isolation for those with major underlying health conditions that place them at high risk. I don't think COVID-19 is ever going away and the idea we can defeat it before re-opening is fatally flawed. We're going to have to rely on being able to cope with it effectively instead.</p>

			 <p>I wanted to write up a few events from the past 2 months of Covid-19 so below is a timeline with nearly one entry for every day. No deep thoughts or personal observations. I saved those for my journal. I also made no effort on prose or formatting. Putting together this timeline was instructive and helps put things in perspective for me.</p>

<p>Feb 20: Attended a meeting with about 150 people&hellip;<br />
Feb 21: First mention of it in my Journal. I noted shortages expected since China factories were closed.<br />
Feb 24: I noted a stock market drop of around 3%<br />
Feb 25: I noted the CDC became more concerned and said the virus was coming to the US. Market down again. I decided to sell some of our assets and park the money in cash for now.<br />
Feb 26: I created a list of emergency supplies. Some, like Advil and allergy meds, were long shelf life items. Others like milk and bread were items we wanted to keep an eye on to ensure we didn&rsquo;t let ourselves get too low in case of panic buying or closures.<br />
Mar 1: I used the end of Feb to assess the market&rsquo;s crash on our Net Worth. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t positive but neither was it large enough to be worrisome.<br />
Mar 3: Made a trip to CVS for Kleenex, Advil etc as the outbreak in the US spread<br />
Mar 5: Asked myself if we should get out during our spring break to go to an arcade or something and my answer at the time was &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.<br />
Mar 9: Made note of the oil price war started by Saudi Arabia and Russia and it&rsquo;s effect on investments<br />
Mar 10: Our daughter went to the mall with her best friend as well as a movie to celebrate the friend&rsquo;s birthday. We weren&rsquo;t really concerned about it.<br />
Mar 11: I went with my wife to the grocery store to do a bit of stocking up. No shortages and no one seemed worried.<br />
Mar 12: School&rsquo;s announce they will be closed. Thought about selling more assets to cash but it didn&rsquo;t feel warranted. My wife and I had planned to go to our favorite BBQ place for dinner but she decided to cancel it due to the virus. She also decides no take out food until this is over.<br />
Mar 13: Trump announces a national emergency.<br />
Mar 14: My wife and I drive through the countryside. Folks weren&rsquo;t changing any behaviors at this stage.<br />
Mar 15: Contemplated how to react to nearly 0% interest rates. Came up with provisional budget cuts for this year and next.<br />
Mar 16: The stock market opened limit down and closed down as well. Wished I had sold more in Feb of course but nevertheless comfortable with our allocation.<br />
Mar 17: I went to the grocery store and picked up some routine items. Meat was running a bit low as well as certain fruit. My wife checked our freezer and decided with &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; orders looming we should pick up some more meat so we made another trip to the grocery store. By this time of day people were a bit frantic.<br />
Mar 18: School closure announced the rest of this month and home learning announced in its place. I took my son to his dentist appointment and our dentist told me they were closing starting Friday.<br />
Mar 20: Markets seemed to be stabilizing. Cases in our county and the area still very low<br />
Mar 21: I implemented our budget cuts and updated our financial plan accordingly. With great reluctance we agreed our teenage daughter could have one of her best friends over in lieu of birthday activities we had to cancel due to the virus.<br />
Mar 22: Sold some more assets in a taxable account. At least that brings a capital loss against taxes for the future.<br />
Mar 25: Came up with a plan to re-invest in the markets as the worst was starting to feel over. Took the first tiny step in doing so. The market is changing faster than I&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<br />
Mar 26: Took note of the fact I expected the virus to pass long before its economic impact does.<br />
Mar 27: Went to the grocery store when they opened. Much busier than normal and a lot of basics were gone.<br />
Mar 29: We took another drive in the country. This time the little towns looked pretty deserted.<br />
Mar 30: Bought a little more stock and sold bonds<br />
Mar 31: I dug out my woodworking masks just in case&hellip; Government project 100K-240K deaths. Schools to stay closed for all of April.<br />
Apr 1: Cases in our county have leapt up including hospitalizations. Of course nothing like NYC. Market has a bad day.<br />
Apr 2: I went to the grocery store when they opened. There was a line of people waiting to get inside.<br />
Apr 3: My wife starts making cloth face masks<br />
Apr 5: I noted I had let my exercise fall away. But also that there was a hint of optimism in the air for the first time.<br />
Apr 6: With some encouraging data from NY I bought equities again. I had a sore throat which worried me&hellip;<br />
Apr 7: Sore throat gone.<br />
Apr 8: Customers at grocery store nearly all wearing masks.<br />
Apr 9: Finished plan for re-investing my cash and made more equity purchases<br />
Apr 11: Our investments have recovered enough I could rollback some of our planned budget cuts.<br />
Apr 12: Easter. It just didn&rsquo;t feel like Easter for us.<br />
Apr 14: Virus cases here have clearly leveled off. Hospital beds and ICUs are only about 50% occupied. Hospitals complain about all the lost revenue from treating heart patients, cancer and so on. My wife gives me permission to get a sandwich from my fave take out place.<br />
Apr 15: Bought some bonds. Our portfolio allocation is make to it&rsquo;s long term target. Never would have expected to get back so fast.</p>

<p>&hellip;More to come of course&hellip;</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m glad the governor is slightly relaxing some restrictions as well as officially closing schools for the rest of the academic year. I&rsquo;ve felt bad that hospital beds are only 50% occupied but patients have been denied cancer biopsies, surgery to relieve pain, etc. Now those people can be treated.</p>

			 <p>As a new Ham (aka amateur radio operator) I was interested in HF from the start. After studying the available transceivers a bit I narrowed my choice down to either the Yaesu FT-991a or the ICOM IC-7300 .The 7300 seemed the better choice due to its more user friendly interface, superior touchscreen, some better processing as well as a larger body of community support. I definitely have not regretted the choice in the 1 month I have owned the radio.
<p>
<img src="uploads/2020/b50ae03a4b.jpg" width="200" height="90" alt="" /></p>

<p>When researching the radio, and as a newbie, I tried to find out what software was available for each brand and whether there were versions I can run on my MacBook Pro. Windows is <b>by far</b> the most popular platform in ham radio and most of the info (YouTube etc) is targeted there. However it turns out there are good choices for Mac users (and Linux too).</p>

<p>One key piece of software for HF is one that can handle contact (QSO) logging. I found two main contenders: RumLogNG (free) and MacLoggerDX ($95). Free always sounds like a good deal so I initially used RumLogNG and was happy with it. In addition to logging it can directly control the 7300 (tuning, RF power setting, noise reduction setting and so on). However I was making a lot of new contacts hence doing a lot of logging and RumLogNG is only semi-automated for uploading to QRZ, eQSL and so on. Also, RumLogNG has very limited support. I tried MacLoggerDX in demo mode and although it lacks the rig control of RumLogNG I found the logging automation, DX spotting and overal user interface implementation superior. Support email was answered within an hour so I made the plunge. As with the 7300 I&rsquo;m happy with the switch though I do miss rig control. On the plus side this forced me to better set up my desk (shack in ham parlance) so everything is now more ergonomic.</p>

<p>The 7300 is trivial to use with the Mac. Simply plug in a USB cable and configure the software to port. Here is a screen shot of MLDX configured for my 7300. Most settings are default.
<p>
<img src="uploads/2020/9375f9a3d0.png" width="248" height="135" alt="" /></p>

<p>The 7300 settings need to be correct for CAT control as well. MacLoggerDX has a page with the details but it isn&rsquo;t so easy to find. <a href="https://www.dogparksoftware.com/MacLoggerDX%20Help/mldxfc_radio_settings.html">The details for each radio are here</a>.</p>

<p>In my next post I want to document the software and settings I&rsquo;m using for HF digital modes like FT8 and JS8Call.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôm a long term investor with a strategy based on portfolio asset allocation. This is a forward thinking approach focused on major changes rather than twitches in valuation.</p>

<p>Around the world, almost every asset class has taken a major hit this month which is of course stressful. But inflection points in markets are times of opportunity. So after spending time last week reducing our planned spending for this year I‚Äôve switched gears. The past few days I‚Äôve been thinking over my existing portfolio and the changes I should make to benefit from the eventual recovery.</p>

<p>But all that‚Äôs not the point of the post. In going through this process I‚Äôve found thinking through something complex and in the future has really helped me cope with the stress of the pandemic. You may not be an investor but maybe you can find something similar that interests you and would be equally beneficial. The virus is our present but it is not our future.</p>

			 <p>The typical rubber ducky and whip antennas included with VHF/UHF handheld transceivers (<a href="https://ronguest.net/2020/03/08/operating-portable-on.html">see previous post here</a>) are inherently inefficient and perform even worse when used indoors, often to the point of being useless. They are generally also limited to 5W of transmit power. For repeater and simplex operation indoors at a minimum an external antenna is needed and a bit more power is helpful as well. For this reason a typical next step for a new ham, after a handheld, is to get a mobile transceiver and install an antenna. Mobile transceivers are commonly used as basestation radios but are also useful when mobile in cars as well as for portable operation during emergencies or just when having fun in a park.</p>

<p>Although I gave a little consideration to an ICOM mobile radio I pretty quickly settled on an inexpensive Yaesu model, the FTM-7250,  as it generally has more features for the price and includes a digital mode called C4FM with WIRES-X.  More on this digital mode in a later post but a cool benefit is the ability to talk to other radio users anywhere in the world.
<img src="uploads/2020/e91d453768.png" width="258" height="146" alt="FTM-7250" /></p>

<p>I spent a lot more time determining what antenna to get because, frankly, the antenna is more important than the radio. VHF/UHF antennas range from cheap to very expensive and from small to quite large and complex. In multiple instances I‚Äôve seen that objective values show that the more complex antennas actually perform worse. So after many hours digging up data I decided to go with a DBJ-1 J-pole made by <a href="https://edsantennas.weebly.com/">Dr. Fong</a>. He is well known for his antenna and RF research and has published a number of papers on the subject of VHF/UHF antennas. He created a simple operation to sell antennas at-cost with the proceeds going to support his students. Once I had narrowed down my choice I emailed him about my purchase and in our email exchanges he proved to be extremely helpful and kind. I consider myself fortunate to have seen a live presentation by him on antenna design, delivered via Skype from his home, a couple of weeks ago. He explained things in simple language and even hams of long experience learned more about antenna design.</p>

<p>The J-Pole is installed in our attic with a coax run to my study. An outdoor installation would perform better but isn&rsquo;t allowed by our HOA.  My setup is more than sufficient to talk on the local repeaters using only 5W or 10W (the Yaesu can use up to 50W when needed). I&rsquo;m happy with both the radio and antenna and have no plans for changes. And I‚Äôm enjoying talking to local operators.</p>

			 <p>In early February the FCC issued my Technician license and I received my General license a couple of weeks later. I dove into operating with both feet so I am creating a series of posts to document my journey. This first post explains my initial setup for VHF/UHF repeater and simplex operation.</p>

<p>As soon as I passed my Technician exam I - like most everyone - was in a hurry to get my hands on a radio and get on the air. And like most I decided to start with a handheld radio. These are self-contained transceivers with respect to both power and an antenna. When seeking advice on what to buy there were two primary schools of thought. One said to buy a Baofeng radio because, although they perform poorly and are difficult to program, they are very inexpensive. A lot of people consider them throw-away buys and are happy with these as a start.<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="uploads/2020/dc3a9d420a.png" width="56" height="94" alt="" /></p></p>

<p>I took the second recommend route which was to start with something that performs better and is more reliable and hence would be something I could use in the long term for Skywarn, emergency comms and public event support. I specifically chose the Yaesu FT-60R. It is an older design but works very well and has a great reputation.  Unlike Baofeng, Yaesu has a long track record of investing in R&amp;D to advance radio technology and I was happy to support their commitment.<br />
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="uploads/2020/5267115eb2.png" width="56" height="94" alt="" /></p></p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m content with my decision but I would have purchased the Yaesu FT-70DR instead. It costs only slightly more but brings digital voice encoding which turns out to be quite useful. And the System Fusion feature in that radio allows communication across the country, even the world. Unfortunately I let some FUD proffered by a few discourage me from valuing digital mode.<br />

			 <p>Welp I thought I was done posting about the Raspberry Pi 4 but I have to add one more thing.</p>

<p>I noticed my Bluetooth keyboards tended to be wonky - trouble staying connected and/or repeating keys. So today I borrowed a different keyboard to try and the same thing happens. After doing some research at the Foundation‚Äôs site it turns out there are a lot of reports of this. The RPi 4 has trouble with Bluetooth keyboards when used simultaneously with WiFi. Since June of last year. Because, you know, nobody uses those two things together.</p>

<p>Solution: Don‚Äôt do that.</p>

<p>Either use a USB keyboard or only use Ethernet. Or you can pay up for a RF keyboard with proprietary dongle.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs aggravating but I consider this defect more an annoyance than the throttling. Though it does further undermine the ‚Äòdesktop alternative‚Äô claims.</p>

<p>Oh, in other news I built a small circuit that will turn the fan on when the CPU heats up. It‚Äôs amazing how annoying even a tiny fan can me in a quiet space.</p>

			 <p>Having posted about the problem of throttling of the Pi 4 under load I didn&rsquo;t want to leave an impression it was a complete loss. So one last post.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve am using every Pi since the 2B, including the Zero and Zero W, and when each iteration was introduced people would talk about it being a desktop computer alternative. That always seemed like wishful thinking to me as web browsing was very slow, video generally didn&rsquo;t work and so on.</p>

<p>The Pi 4, in spite of throttling, can actually deliver what I would consider a meets-min desktop experience. I streamed 15 minutes of full-screen YouTube videos and it handled it just fine (27‚Äù monitor). Without the fan running the temperature did continually creep up but it didn&rsquo;t reach the stage of throttling. With the fan running the temperature was both lower and stable. I also have a web service that pushes a large JSON file to the browser every second and the display updates in Chromium was smooth and responsive. Other aspects of the desktop experience were responsive as well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve used all my other Pis as headless Linux boxes. I could see using the Pi 4 with a UI/desktop interface and not wanting to poke my eyes out. That&rsquo;s quite an accomplishment for a device starting at US$35.</p>

			 <p>I continued to see the Pi 4 throttle regularly. Since the official Raspberry Pi 4 case was basically worthless I decided to use my 1‚Äù hole saw to poke a hole in the top. Normally fans are placed inside the case but since the fan needed a 1 1/8‚Äù opening and I didn‚Äôt have that size hole saw I installed the fan on top of the case.</p>

<p>This setup prevented throttling under my real-world loads which was good news. I then disconnected the fan and ran some of the same applications. Even without the fan running the Pi didn‚Äôt throttle. That is good news but it confirms my opinion that the Pi Foundation was foolish to produce an official case with no passive ventilation. Such a simple change would improve OOTB user experience.</p>

<p>I plan to post some more general observations on the Pi 4‚Äôs performance in the near future.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2020/01/18/the-raspberry-pi.html">The Raspberry Pi 4 is a step up in theory but in practice they‚Äôve undermined the value proposition</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When the Raspberry Pi 4 came out there was quite a fuss about how easily it had to throttle it‚Äôs cores due to heat under any sort of load. Throttling means it‚Äôs theoretical specs are not realized in the real world. The foundation issued several firmware fixes to address this over the past year.</p>

<p>Based on my experience this is still a major issue. The foundation is making the situation worse by some odd choices they took. First they don‚Äôt include a heat sink on the processor (or anywhere else). Having heard of the heat issues I ordered a heat sink with mine and installed it right away.</p>

<p>The second problem is the rather stupid decision they made to provide absolutely no ventilation in their official case. The top is completely solid. So they‚Äôre selling a CPU prone to overheating with no heat sink and no provision for passive ventilation in their case.</p>

<p>The very first app I ran (other than the installer and Chromium) resulted in a flashing thermometer on the display indicating the Pi was throttling. I removed the top from the case and felt the heat sink - it was hot enough to burn a finger. I removed the top from the case, exposing the heat sink to open air, and the throttling decreased significantly. Since this experience every time I have the top on and run something that stresses the CPU it throttles.</p>

<p>For comparison I have a Pi 3 B+ in the attic. In a case. In Texas. In the summers. And it doesn‚Äôt over heat.</p>

<p>I have a tiny fan I could use and to do something as suggested in <a href="https://howchoo.com/g/zmvjzwmzmjm/add-raspberry-pi-4-cooling-fan">this guide</a> to install it in the case and implement automatic fan control. Of course in the vein of Murphy‚Äôs law this requires a 1 1/8‚Äù hole saw for my drill and the closest thing I have is a 1‚Äù hole saw. After measuring for myself I can tell that would hinder air flow from the fan. So I‚Äôd have to buy another bit in order to make this case work. Or for the same cost as the bit I can throw the official case away and buy a 3rd party case with ventilation slots and a built in fan. Hence my frustration with the decisions by the foundation.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2019/12/30/i-rejected-diet.html">I rejected diet and activity tracking apps and came up with this simpler and better(?) approach to meet my needs</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For several years I&rsquo;ve done those things people say you should to track and manage diet and exercise/fitness. For over a year I logged everything I ate in MyFitnessPal, logged my weight daily, and used my iPhone/Apple Watch to track standing, movement and exercise. Each was helpful, at least in short bursts, but after each of my pushes the outcome was pretty disappointing. Flaws, to me, include the information being disjointed across these apps even though I could pull it all into the Health app on my iPhone. The data was just that - a bunch for data with a limited clue as to compliance and history. It was hard to see trends and to see how these different aspects of my life interacted. And MyFitnessPal (and it&rsquo;s ilk) are really tedious to do for any length of time. I also tried using automated tools in apps like Things and Day One to have me keep track myself and those didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stick&rdquo; and didn&rsquo;t satisfy my complaints either.</p>

<p>Since I wasn&rsquo;t happy with where I was health-wise and didn&rsquo;t feel like these tools were working for me I decided to take a different approach. And, once again proving I&rsquo;m a nerd, I decided a spreadsheet would better allow me to document my activity and dietary goals for each day and then to track compliance. So about a month ago I created a spreadsheet table with a column for each day and 4 rows of activities and 7 rows of dietary objectives. Even though it is a spreadsheet the cells are simply checkboxes. When I am compliance for the row I check off the box. Some items are positives like getting in my aerobic exercise for the day and others are negatives such as not eating a carb snack in the morning. The bottom row of the spreadsheet totals up the check marked cells. Achieving 7 is the bare minimum and earns a yellow status while 8 or more is good compliance and is a green status. I can quickly open and update the day&rsquo;s status on any device and in doing so also get a reminder of what I am supposed to be doing and how today compares to previous days.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;m really happy with this approach - it suits my style and personality quite well. Below is a an example of a one week snapshot. Wednesday&rsquo;s is colored green because that was Christmas Day and I made that a complete cheat day. Friday and Saturday&rsquo;s compliance is poor due to a road trip (noted in a comment on Friday). Monday (today as I draft this post) hasn&rsquo;t yet met the objective (but there&rsquo;s still time!). And Tuesday is blank because it isn&rsquo;t Tuesday yet. Fortunately my compliance was better leading up to Christmas week!</p>

<p>The actual spreadsheet has more personal details about my objectives as well as having one tab for each month and one column for every day of the month.</p>

<p>N.B. I still use and value Apple&rsquo;s health related apps for tracking the details and for it&rsquo;s gamification of compliance but overall this spreadsheet is now the key for me. Also I considered making some items in the spreadsheet worth more than others. But I elected to keep it simple and also stay conscious of the fact that the core purpose was to come close to 100% compliance each day.</p>

			 <p>Based on my time at Best Buy today, having them fix their battery replacement on my iPhone X, AirPods are a huge success as gifts. I saw a ton of people picking them up from the pre-purchase desk. Apple Watches were a distant second. Don‚Äôt think I saw 2 of anything else.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Now that the nearest Apple Store is 1.5 hours away, round trip, I decided to try Best Buy‚Äôs authorized service to do an in-warranty replacement of my iPhone X battery. The Best Buy is about 5 minutes away so it would save a ton of drive time.</p>

<p>It took the guy that waited on me 45 minutes from the time he started until he finished checking in my phone for the repair. This doesn‚Äôt include any time in line. Other staff seemed more competent.</p>

<p>The good news is they completed the repair in the estimated time window of 3 hours. The bad news is that I noticed after getting home the case and screen aren‚Äôt fitted together properly. The bottom left corner of the screen is elevated above the case. I imagine this means the water resistance is non-existent now.</p>

<p>I really don‚Äôt want to give up my phone for another half day but I don‚Äôt think I have any choice but to return and hope they can get it right on the second try. If so I will still probably have saved on drive time but at the cost of heightened annoyance. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd trust them with a phone again.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I returned to the store today and of course the same guy that faced so much trouble checking me in was at the counter. But by luck and much more competent woman became available. She got me checked in immediately, walked the phone to the back, and returned to tell me they would have it fixed in about 15 minutes. True to their word they did and the phone is back to normal. I had been afarid I&rsquo;d have to leave it again so I was quite relieved to be in and out in under 30 minutes.</p>

			 <p>The battery in my iPhone X has entered the ‚Äúdegraded‚Äù stage and needs to be replaced. Since the nearest Apple stores are fairly distant I‚Äôm going to try using Best Buy (arranged by Apple). Hopefully I won‚Äôt regret this - but a battery replacement seems easy enough. üì±</p>

			 <p>We have a lot of Apple devices including a couple of AppleTVs and I&rsquo;ve been anxiously awaiting today&rsquo;s updates. I started the updates on several of the devices which all went well until I turned on the AppleTV in our den to trigger the tvOS update. Everything turned on correctly and I grabbed the remote to tell it to open Settings and <em>nothing</em>. The ATV didn&rsquo;t react to the remote at all. Fortunately I had a universal remote which I could use to restart the ATV. That didn&rsquo;t help, the remote was still n/c.</p>

<p>I noticed in the Settings app it was telling me I needed to use an iDevice to reauthorize my account. This is normally instant as you just have to hold the iDevice near the ATV box. But it turned into a fussy affair. It didn&rsquo;t stick the first two times I used my iPhone. So I grabbed my iPad and used that - twice - and after restarting the ATV I finally got that to work. But still no joy on the remote. I have no idea if these were related (and this was the only one of our ATV&rsquo;s that asked me to re-auth).</p>

<p>I next unpaired the ATV remote and then tried to re-pair it. The ATV noticed and told me to move closer but I had the remote on top of the ATV and there was no way to get it closer. Next idea was to charge the remote even though it had been charged recently. This didn&rsquo;t help either. After scrounging up an pre-ATV4K remote I decided to try to pair the failed remote as if it were a plain Bluetooth device. Voila. The remote showed up as a regular device and I could pair it that way. And it is fully functional now even though paired as a generic device (this mainly means voice control works). Hopefully this is a one-off thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really glad this problem crept up before I updated the ATV else I likely would have gone down a rathole thinking the update was at fault.</p>

			 <p>After removing my Apple Card from the UPS envelope I was surprised to be greeted with something more substantial than the typical envelope used for other credit cards.</p>

<p>The brown outer packaging was made from recycled paper that was similar to a very heavy paper stock. The brown paper easily held it&rsquo;s squared-off corners for example. Inside was the holder for the card itself which was made out of high quality stock similar to that used in good greeting cards and a nicely embossed Apple logo. The holder was a typical Apple white. The inside had the same color gradients used in the Wallet app. As usual with Apple the packaging was a pleasure.</p>

<p>The card itself is only slightly thicker than others I have. I was a bit surprised that it is not what I call &ldquo;Apple white&rdquo; but instead has a bit of a steel/grey cast (though in the photo it looks warmer). There is a definite metallic clink when the card is put on a wood table. I imagine if you were to drop the card on a hard floor the resulting sound would be very noticeable.</p>

<p>In looking over the FAQs I discovered <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209225">the process for doing an in-store return other than at Apple</a> is a bit different than with other cards. I imagine this will cause a few hiccups until it is better known. As far as the other T&amp;C I think this would be a good card for my kids when they&rsquo;re old enough (not sure they would be approved for one though). In my case I will start carrying the Apple Card as my emergency backup card (not my main card as it pays 2% on all purchases).</p>

<p>My main annoyance with the card‚Äôs features is the lack of a method to export transactions to budgeting software (e.g. an OFX file or even a CSV file). A PDF statement is the only export available. I think this a real weakness for a card that is themed as being friendlier to responsible spending. As far as the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t carry it in a leather wallet&rdquo; posts I don&rsquo;t really care. None of my credit cards looks new and if I got bothered enough by the Apple Card discoloring they&rsquo;ll send a replacement free.</p>

There is also live music, a pageant and a parade (among other activities including throwing water at each other). Attending Songkran is a good chance to sample Lao street food without the long flight.</p>

<p>By tradition it was actually two weeks ago but we have a number of Wats in the area and they each pick a weekend in April to host a 3 day celebration. We made our annual visit this weekend (more photos to come).</p>

		<a href="https://ronguest.net/2019/04/27/apples-give-back.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-04-27 07:34:20 -0600">Apr 27, 2019</time></a>

			 <p>Apple&rsquo;s Give Back program has been a mixed bag for me this year, though mostly misses
‚ûïThey gave us a better price for my wife&rsquo;s first gen 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro than others
‚ûñApple&rsquo;s Give Back made a decent offer for our son&rsquo;s iPad Air 2 but set the value to $0 when they received it because they said it wouldn&rsquo;t power on(!?!). I told them to send it back and when it arrived it powered on fine and still had 94% charge. I complained but got no answer. Gazelle came to the rescue, said it checked out fine, and paid us.
‚ûñApple&rsquo;s Give Back wouldn&rsquo;t even make an offer on my 2013 MBP with the wonky battery. Again Gazelle came to the rescue and paid me a good price.</p>

<p>It seems Apple&rsquo;s Give Back is tuned for newer gear and is pickier, or even shady, about the condition of items. But when Give Back pays it can be the best price. Over a longer history I&rsquo;d say Gazelle accepts a wider range of gear and is reliable and has the advantage of providing funds that can be spent outside Apple‚Äôs stores.</p>

		<a href="https://ronguest.net/2019/02/26/window-on-weather.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-02-26 12:52:24 -0600">Feb 26, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Earlier this year <a href="https://micro.blog/johnjohnston">@johnjohnston</a> posted animated GIF images of the sky/weather based on a Raspberry Pi setup. I&rsquo;m a bit of a weather nerd and the idea appealed to me especially since I had an older Raspberry Pi and Pi camera sitting idle. But I wasn&rsquo;t much interested in animated GIFs based on a general aversion but also because the video quality is rather poor.</p>

<p>I set up the Pi with the camera pointed at the sky on the front of my house and created a <a href="https://github.com/ronguest/window-on-weather"><em>Window on Weather</em> repo in Github</a> comprised of a couple of bash scripts and a Python script. Every 10 minutes the Pi captures a short set of still images which are compiled into an animated GIF but more usefully to me an MP4 time lapse covering 10 minutes of real time. The resulting MP4 is about 10 seconds in length. I also created a script which creates a 1 hour MP4 compilation which has a viewing time about 1 minute. The file size of a 10 minute time lapse MP4 is a typically less than 10MB and, rather interestingly to me, is smaller than the animated GIF. The MP4 compilation of 1 hour of sky time comes out to less than 50MB. Images for the most recent 3 days are available on the Pi via Apache.</p>

<p>I enjoy looking at the MP4 time lapses on a regular basis. Even when the sky seems uninteresting the time lapse often reveals lovely changes. I feel like I should make stills or the MP4 publicly available but I haven&rsquo;t yet delved into a hardened and usable method of providing a gallery. Plus I&rsquo;m not sure there is an audience.</p>

<p>I finally found a use for my old Flickr account üòÉ and posted a couple of sample videos there. <a href="https://flic.kr/p/2eWEbLH">This is a MP4 from a mostly sunny day</a> and <a href="https://flic.kr/p/24kbaRp">this one is of a day with clouds coasting by</a>. Unusually for Texas the weather the past week has been flipping between severe clear and a pretty uniform overcast, neither of which makes the most interesting viewing. I think this project will be especially interesting when thunderstorm season starts.</p>

<p>The repo includes a housekeeping script that removes old files periodically so the SD card doesn&rsquo;t clog up as well as the crontab entries I use to run everything.</p>

			 <p><em>Thunder and lightning very very frightening&hellip;</em> ‚õà  A tale of woe wrought by nature</p>

<p>A storm woke us up last night and shortly after a very loud thunder clap &amp; flash. I couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep so I got up early feeling rather groggy only to discover a rather odd 90% of our devices were offline but the router was on the Internet. Took me a long time to figure out what caused the strange collection of outages. A gigabit switch failed which knocked out WiFi for a lot of devices (because the WiFi extender backhauled over Ethernet through the switch) and also of course all of the devices, like AppleTVs, on that switch were offline.</p>

<p>I managed to get most things back online by plugging a few key Ethernet cables directly into the router in our wiring box. While finishing that up there was a loud flash, click and poof. The power strip in the wiring box shorted out one of the outlets and tripped our whole-house surge protector in the process. I was even more awake, and more irritated. Thankfully the now blackened power strip was the only casualty and not the devices plugged into it - otherwise we‚Äôd be without any Internet waiting for a new modem from AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>Even with juggling Ethernet cables I still can‚Äôt get part of the house‚Äôs wired devices back online and I can find no cause for that. I‚Äôll have to make a run first thing this morning for a new Gigabit switch and surge protector strip. Hopefully that will bring everything back online but if not I‚Äôll have some trouble trying to track down the remaining issue.</p>

<p>Frustrating but nothing serious from a life perspective so grateful for that.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been mulling over the Netflix price increase. In terms of our budget it isn‚Äôt meaningful but I find myself displeased. I think the money is used to pay for expensive original content which happens to not appeal to us - we just don&rsquo;t watch it. At one point in time they had what I considered to be the most user friendly UI amongst streaming services on top of diverse content. But they&rsquo;ve made it less user-friendly and more &ldquo;watch what we tell you to watch&rdquo;. And on our AppleTV if we try to browse through shows it immediately plays previews and there is no way to disable that. It is really annoying trying to look at a descriptions and all the sudden this loud preview plays. Often our watch list is buried below lists of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s hot&rdquo; and etc (I have no idea why this moves around).</p>

<p>At one point multiple streams had us on their top-priced plan and I had forgotten that. Today I downgraded our plan to the middle one. For the first time I can see us living without Netflix. Since it was our first streaming service it&rsquo;s a bit sad.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not shocked by this data at all. I often wonder there are any women left on Twitter given the volume of random abuse the ones I know receive. The platform continues to prove it has zero values that stand up against abuse. It only acts when threatened. This is part of why I am here on Micro.blog and support the measures taken to prevent/manage this type of abuse.</p>

<p>A few quotes:
&gt; &hellip;female journalists and politicians were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017.
&gt; &hellip;black women were 84 percent more likely to be mentioned in abusive tweets than white women
&gt; Twitter&rsquo;s failure to crack down on this problem means it is contributing to the silencing of already marginalized voices.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m really happy with my upgrade to the 2018 12.9&rdquo; iPad Pro with the Smart Keyboard and pencil. Like my upgrade from my Apple Watch 0 to Series 4, it is much more capable. So much that it has eaten further into the time I spend on my laptop. This isn&rsquo;t about trying to replace my laptop with an iPad but about enabling me to work on a task whenever and wherever. I&rsquo;ve never done well tied to a single desk or office. My productivity and creativity is spurred by moving around from den to kitchen to home office or from office desk to conference room to a break room. Coffee shops fit into the mix as well. It&rsquo;s just what makes me tick and the iPad is a better much for much of what I do.</p>

<p>I used to use my 9.7&rdquo; Pro almost exclusively as a lap or handheld device. But with the additional time I spend on the iPad after upgrading along with the increased amount of &ldquo;pro&rdquo; work I use it for I&rsquo;ve found I am opting to sit at a desk or table fairly regularly. In my home office my MBP was connected to a LG 34&rdquo; UltraWide monitor which provides an expansive viewing area for sure and was very handy in my days as a corp exec leveraging my ADHD to see and work on tons of things at one time. Now I&rsquo;m back to running my own show I&rsquo;ve worked to wean myself from what I consider to be bad habits and haven&rsquo;t really been making use of the screen real estate. And the thing takes up a ton of real estate on my desk.</p>

<p>So this weekend I replaced the LG with a 21&rdquo; HP monitor my former employer had given me a couple years ago. I also moved my MBP from a position relegated to a side table it is now on a stand next to the monitor as a two-display setup. This combined with use of full screen mode in apps aids focus. I revisited which items had earned a place on my desk and stowed some of them to get a cleaner look and work surface. The result makes it much easier to plop down at my desk and use my iPad instead of the laptop and also to have the iPad off the right if I want to use both at the same time. I find clutter distracting and disturbing in a subconscious way so I&rsquo;m pretty happy with this result. I have a few more things I may do but the picture shows what I ended up with.</p>

<p>N.B. I would not buy anything from LG again, horrible warranty service.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Inspired by <a href="https://micro.blog/mmarfil">@mmarfil</a> I thought I should look and see what my top 5 Shortcuts are. I imagine there are a number of nearly identical Shortcuts floating around. Most I typically invoke using Siri.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Loud Playlist</strong><br />
I invoke this either from the widget or using Siri and it fires up Music to play my <em>Loud</em> playlist, shuffled, without repeat. This is possible using Siri, without a Shortcut, but I found that having a Shortcut with my recorded phrase makes it more reliable. I have this in the widget because there are times where I&rsquo;d rather swipe to invoke it than speak. I actually have a couple of Shortcuts like this that play different lists.<br />
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/4df260c446974735a4f0bdf3ba6cd111">Get the Shortcut</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Save File as&hellip;</strong>
I often want to save a web page or a PDF from Safari (such as a utility bill or bank statement). This Shortcut prompts me for a file name and then a places on my iCloud Drive to save it. Picking a file name should be a built-in iOS feature for now it isn&rsquo;t. Typically for this to work it is necessary to first use the share sheet option to <em>Create PDF</em> and then run this workflow. It would be nice if the Shortcut could invoke <em>Create PDF</em> but as far as I can determine that is not supported.<br />
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/8a6a38612e0643d5a8a2a26f7f690255">Get the Shortcut</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Add To Tomorrow</strong>
Things3 is my task manager and it introduced Shortcuts support from the beginning. Things3 has a built in way to add something from the Share sheet but there is no option to pick a destination &ndash; it always goes to the Inbox. Using this Shortcut I add the current page in Safari as a task to my <em>Tomorrow</em> list (I also have Shortcuts to add an item to <em>Today</em> or my <em>Read Later</em> list. I typically invoke this using Siri.<br />
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6905c76ef5e14d7fa8417ed90f67195d">Get the Shortcut</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Open Shopping</strong>
I also have a <em>Shopping</em> project in Things3 where I keep items I want to purchase. Some of these items are wishlist and others are near term. I keep a <em>Groceries</em> task and within that maintain a checklist of what I need to pick up. I have another for <em>Drug Store</em> reminding me what I want to get on my next visit to Walgreens, CVS or wherever and similarly for <em>Hardware Store</em>. When I start to run errands I can invoke this Shortcut for a reminder of places I might need to go or when I arrive at a store and and want to see the checklist. I have similar Shortcuts that will open Things3 to my <em>Today</em> list of tasks or my <em>Upcoming</em> list of tasks.<br />
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2ff983e176294e37ac8c3391df83601c">Get the Shortcut</a></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Nap Alarm Time</strong>
Who doesn&rsquo;t like a good nap? But all good things must end and I typically need an alarm to nudge me to get up and get going again. This Shortcut prompts for the duration of the nap and then adjust the volume and sets DND mode.<br />

			 <p>Last month I set a goal to follow 100 people on Micro.blog by the end of the year (I was at 79 at the time).  I easily surpassed that goal yesterday and it is very nice to see the quality of my timeline remains high. üíØ</p>

<p>On social media like Facebook and Twitter virtually everyone I interact(ed) with is someone I knew before (family, friends, colleagues). In the early days of Flickr almost everyone I interacted with was new to me and I still have very fond memories of that period and retain some of those people as friends. Micro.blog is the only other instance where I‚Äôve met a lot of smart, reasonable and kind people online and felt it was a net benefit to me. I recently tried Mastodon and at least my experience hasn‚Äôt been good and I doubt I‚Äôll really participate there.</p>

<p>Like some others I have a long list of things (I think?) I‚Äôd like to see changed on Micro.blog. But at the same time I really appreciate that they‚Äôre taking their time to manage the experience. Flickr ruined the social aspects (as well as undermining it as a serious, or at least semi-serious) site for discussing photos. I wouldn‚Äôt want to see that happen again.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/12/04/a-quick-note.html">A quick note on my replacement for Adobe Photoshop and on their onerous approach to subscriptions aka ‚ÄúCreative Cloud‚Äù</a></h1>

			 <p>A few months back I dropped the Adobe Photo plan subscription. I‚Äôve never gotten along with Lightroom (still pining for Aperture!) and didn‚Äôt feel the cost justified my infrequent and light usage of Photoshop. Their recent approach to Cloud storage and deprecation of the standalone app left a really bad taste in my mouth. Plus, for me, their Cloud approach made for an extremely awkward workflow. I‚Äôve been doing simple work in Apple‚Äôs Photos app on iOS and macOS as well as randomly using apps like Darkroom on iOS for more advanced photo processing.</p>

<p>I recently needed to do some Photoshop-type photo editing and recalled getting <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/">Affinity Photo</a> for macOS for free about a year ago. I fired it up and It was a <strong>great</strong> alternative and I quickly accomplished what I needed. After doing some research I decided to buy the iOS version. It is quite powerful and after watching a couple of their tutorial videos I‚Äôm getting along quite well with it. I appreciate they put in the work to do some very clever things to take advantage of a touch device. It feels good and is a productive approach - better than on my Mac.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: this is just my opinion, I get nothing out of posting this, and don‚Äôt know anyone working for the company.
N.B. I wish people disclosed this kind of information in posts about products. I often see people post positive comments on product‚Äôs and later find they are compensated, have a relationship with, or get special privileges from the company. Not cool.</p>

* I use my MacBook Pro for hardware and software development, some macOS-only financial reports, and bulk photo processing. Everything else is on my iPad (even some script development).</p>

<p>Our son could easily live without a Mac. Our daughter lives without an iPad. I need both. So amongst us, given our life stages and interests, it‚Äôs 50-50. I don‚Äôt see anything happening the next couple of years that result in us eliminating Macs.</p>

<p>The main difference the iPad has driven for us is we no longer need two Macs and our Macs will last longer (our 5 year old iMac is still doing surprisingly well playing games). There is also an implication for my backup strategy as more and more data shifts to iPads ‚Äî even my code is in iCloud (as well as on the Mac and Github). My 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro is awesome but it can‚Äôt compete with the development productivity having an ultra-wide monitor, true windowing, background tasks etc bring. I don‚Äôt see any way this is going to change in the next couple of years. I think if Apple made a strategic shift to enable this kind of thing on iOS it would be a huge mistake for the general iOS user base. I can see them making some moves to support development but not to the point of trying to replace Macs.</p>

<p>I am not sure what impact the advent of iPads has on Apple&rsquo;s share-of-wallet. The iPads are personal devices so each person needs one (for our family even if the iPad had user profiles this would still be the case). The upfront cost of iPads is marginally cheaper than buying a couple of Macs however Apple is driving a faster refresh cycle on iPads. The rate of improvement of iPads vs Macs makes it hard to resist regular upgrades (at least for the parental units) and in practice I think these costs will exceed a Mac-focused approach.</p>

			 <p>There are a lot of pieces and connections (some required, some optional) for users adopting Micro.Blog. As a new user back in January I was often a bit muddled about the relationships. I decided to map out the ones I‚Äôm aware of. I‚Äôve used many of these myself.</p>

<ul>
<li>The left column lists many of the ways a user can post using micro.blog. This is more important than you might think because none of those boxes is <em>equal</em> to the other. They each have limitations/advantages or bugs that impact what you can/can‚Äôt do. Especially early on I spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out which to use. It‚Äôs gotten better lately.</li>
<li>The center column, above the backend, has some apps/sites that also host blogs (I just listed WordPress and blot.im for now).</li>
<li>Along the bottom I drew the micro.blog backend in the center pushing updates to Github pages which is then cloned to a repo on my Mac. Since that clone is in an iCloud folder it serves as a sort of crude and imperfect <em>backup of last resort</em>.</li>
<li>The column on the right shows destinations other than Github pages: the micro.blog timeline, Twitter, Mastodon, and etc. I put Instagram there as well but I didn‚Äôt connect it yet because I haven‚Äôt successfully used OwnYourGram (I‚Äôm sure I just need to spend more time on it). N.B. I don‚Äôt currently cross-post to Twitter either.</li>
</ul>

<p>I‚Äôm a rather visual person for data like this so it is helpful to me. Not sure if it helps anyone else.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>With all the changes in the social media world the past year or two and the rise of new ways to blog/post I find my mind in a bit of a muddle. I&rsquo;d really like your input on a simple approach to achieve what I¬†<em>think</em> I&rsquo;m aiming for. Here are the attributes I&rsquo;d like to have (probably not complete but the best I&rsquo;ve come up with):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Portability:¬†</strong>I want my posts to be portable. By this I mean if however I'm hosting the content goes boom (or I just want to change my setup/services) I have full access to my content in a form I can import in an automated way. I have &gt;10 years of posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Private Journal Support:¬†</strong>I want to (continue) to have an automation that adds my new posts to my private journal (Day One using IFTTT currently).</li>
    <li><strong>Content-type Feeds:¬†</strong>Optionally I'd like to separate out feeds into short posts, long posts, and image/video posts.</li>
    <li><strong>IndieWeb:¬†</strong>I want my setup to be "IndieWeb Conformant" (not a real thing but I think you can guess what I mean). This includes aspects such as authentication, collecting responses, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-posting:¬†</strong>I want¬†<em>one post to rule them all</em>. By this I mean I want to be able to selectively distribute my posts to any site/service. Of course some sites/services are not open to this but I want what I'm using to make it possible as much as reasonable. The most important platform for my client app is iOS. macOS is optional as long as there is a browser option.
<ul>
    <li>At present I think cross-posting to micro.blog, mastodon and possible Twitter are important to me. I stopped posting to Twitter about 6 months ago but if they follow through on the changes mentioned recently I might return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><strong>Site Design:¬†</strong>I want to have some control over the format/display of my site, ability to add new pages, backgrounds or etc. I generally like clean and simple formats (such as on blot.im and to an extent micro.blog).</li>
    <li><strong>Backup:¬†</strong>My content needs to have a solid backup method.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability:¬†</strong>I want the services I use to have good support, reliablility and performance. I'm a low volume poster.</li>
    <li><strong>Ease of Maintenance:¬†</strong>I would like it to "just work" unless I happen to be <del>breaking it</del>¬†making improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I started using <a href="https://micro.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micro.blog</a> in January it covered some of this but there were some major gaps. There have been marked improvements but some areas of concern remain (I haven&rsquo;t gotten the impression these will be addressed in the foreseeable future):</p>

<ul>
    <li>Portability (I may not understand but GitHub pages doesn't seem like a good approach)</li>
    <li>Micro.blog doesn't doesn't really allow me to control where a post goes on a post-by-post basis. It's easy to forget the last setting used and there are no visual clues in the UI.</li>
    <li>Backup (again, only Github pages as far as I know)</li>
    <li>Reliability is still a bit of a concern as I regularly get errors/timeouts trying to post. I am also concerned that the backend of MB is a "one man band" and it's future depends on a single person.</li>
</ul>

<p>At present I have a self-hosted WordPress instance for my content (<a href="https://ron.theguests.us/2018/05/02/my-indieweb-ish-wordpress-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some notes on the setup here</a>). It&rsquo;s been rock solid on reliability (whenever the MB clients can&rsquo;t post WP always works) and is relatively portable. But it&rsquo;s high(er) maintenance and completely overpowered for my needs &ndash; it gives me the same feeling I get when I order food at a restaurant and they serve me a plate with more food than I could eat in a week. I would also say that my setup is a &ldquo;one man band&rdquo; so if I tire of maintaining WP or am sick for awhile or etc it might go down.</p>

<p>Nothing is perfect in technology. Looking over my list vis-a-vis Micro.blog I think I could go back to a MB hosted approach if there was a better solution for portability/backup. In any event, I&rsquo;m open to any and all input. It will soon be a year since I decided to go the &ldquo;microblogging&rdquo; route and it seems like it is high time I settled on my approach.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/11/06/004830.html">My saga creating an external SSD for booting Windows 10 on my iMac: failure, failure, failure, success</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/11/06/004830.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-06 18:48:30 -0600">Nov 6, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I thought I‚Äôd post a quick summary of the journey to getting Windows 10 to boot on my iMac using an external SSD drive.</p>

<p>I first tried <a href="https://blog.macsales.com/40947-tech-tip-how-to-use-boot-camp-on-an-external-drive">this approach using VirtualBox</a>. There are several posts that document similar approaches. This quickly - for anything that involves installing Windows - produced an external SSD that would boot on my 2013 MBP. But in spite of trying several variations of this process I was never able to get it to boot up on my 2013 iMac (Fusion drive model). I‚Äôve found Fusion drives to be very fussy so I‚Äôm not totally surprised but had been hopeful because I was using an external disk and so the fusion drive shouldn‚Äôt really have been a factor. Last year I created a Boot Camp partition on the Fusion drive and that required some serious shell level disk hacking. Since getting the external SSD to work for Windows would enable me to extend the life of the iMac quite a bit I was motivated to find a solution so I kept digging.</p>

<p>I eventually tumbled on a completely <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/08/31/how-windows-10-mac-boot-camp-external-drive-video/">different approach which is based on a Microsoft technology called Windows To Go</a>. Even with this it took me several tries to get it to work and even then there were some oddities. I only had a Windows Home license and the approach documented here wouldn‚Äôt work with that version (at least not for me, Windows To Go is stated as not supporting the Home edition but I had given it a try anyway). Having already fussed with this for more than half a day I coughed up the $100 to upgrade to a Pro license. Once that was done I started from scratch once again and ended up with a Windows install that successfully booted my iMac. It performs pretty well i.e. much much faster than the Fusion boot camp partition. One of the resulting oddities is I can‚Äôt use the Boot Camp tool in Windows to boot into Mac OS X. I have to do a restart, hold the Option key, then pick the macOS boot disk. The second oddity is similar: the SSD no longer shows up as a bootable option in System Preferences on the iMac. It‚Äôs necessary to hold do the Option key when restarting and then pick a disk which is named ‚ÄúEFI Boot‚Äù. If you‚Äôre thinking of using this approach be sure to check out the first comment on the 9to5mac blog which points out an upgrade limitation which might eventually matter.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm hoping this will also have the advantage of allowing me to boot this Windows SSD on either my iMac or MBP should the need arise. But knowing Windows I‚Äôll hope to avoid trying this out.</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve seen quite a few posts, here and elsewhere, about the cost of the new iPad Pros. My interest is in the high end so I feel the pain and I am hesitant to upgrade. But I‚Äôm not sure Apple is hurting itself since iPads still start at $329 with several price points above that. I think it best to compare to laptop prices which start at a few hundred dollars for a basic model and rise to a couple of thousand. Screens, speed and storage are the main drivers of those costs differences as well. Maybe I tend to think of this analog because my iPad is my main computer (even though I also have an older MBP I use it less than 10% of the time).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/10/23/163857.html">Impact of the mid-term election on my social media participation?</a></h1>

			 <p>I‚Äôm wondering what the mid-term election results will do to my social media participation. After the presidential results I ran and hid for a couple of months to get away from all the negative energy people were constantly venting (even though I agreed with their POV). At least for me negative energy is counterproductive to driving change, serves to drive further polarization, as well as hurting (my) personal well-being. I avoid it in real life and social media is no exception. I don‚Äôt know if the community on MB and the tools in the apps well be effective in managing this or not (e.g. mute doesn‚Äôt work right IMO). Time will tell but I am a bit hopeful.</p>

			 <p>For reference I updated from a Series 0 to a Series 4 with a cellular plan.</p>

<ul>
    <li>To get the bad out of the way first, my only real disappointment is Raise to talk to Siri. Sometimes it works like magic but 50% of the time it doesn't activate. It makes me feel awkward and self conscious when I talk to my watch and absolutely nothing happens. I have not figure out why. OK, the rest is positives...</li>
<ul>
    <li>Well, there is one other thing that really bothers me though I knew about it ahead of time: The Watch should be able to stream music to my car's Bluetooth. Inability to do this is a major chink in the "ok to leave your phone at home" concept.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>Size: I went from the 42mm to the 44mm and was a bit worried about the size since my wrist is on a bit small. But the 4mm looks ok on me and feels smaller and lighter than the old 42mm.</li>
    <li>Appearance: When the iPhone X came out I didn't plan to do an upgrade. But while having a battery replaced at an Apple Store I gave it a look and a feel (!) and instantly wanted to upgrade. The Series 4 doesn't have the same impact but it definitely looks better than the Series 0 and has something of the look of the iPhone X.</li>
    <li>Display: Really bright, very clear, and functionally seems much larger than the physical increase would indicate. I turned text size down to the smallest setting.</li>
    <li>Water: I like to listen to music when I shower and it was always annoying to be in there when songs came on I wasn't in the mood to listen to. I wear the Series 4 whenever I shower and I can use both touch and voice to control my music. This is pure joy for me.</li>
    <li>Infographs: I am using both of the Infograph faces. I have a Modular face set up for weekends and the other set up for weekdays because I have a different focus on those days. I welcome the addition of these new faces but I like symmetry and some of the complications around the edge have one design (e.g. arced with a color gradient) and others have a clashing design (circular). It took me quite awhile to come up with complications for each corner that didn't feel off balance. I'm only using 2 of the sub-dial slots (top and bottom, left and right are empty). Aside: for some reason the AQI complication often fails to display any data even though the UV complication always works.</li>
    <li>Sleep: I now sleep with my watch on. Partly because I am using AutoSleep to track my sleep pattern and quality and partly because I hate having to unlock my watch when I first wake up. It's great to be able to give Siri commands via my watch as soon as I get up (my iPhone sleeps in my office, not my bedroom). And AutoSleep works well.</li>
    <li>Battery: I've had the watch a couple of weeks and I have never gotten it charged to 100% since I'm sleeping with the watch on. I usually charge the watch a couple of hours in the evening and with that the battery hasn't dropped below 18%.</li>
    <li>Performance: It's great. Don't know what else to say about it.</li>
    <li>Wallet: My Series 0 wasn't responsive enough to ever use the wallet/Apple Pay. I would always feel like a nerd when I tried and then it would fail in a shop full of people. The Series 4 works perfectly so I use the Wallet several times a week.</li>
    <li>Connectivity: With all the options in Series 4 with cellular it has naturally been quite good. But it's only a 4/5 stars so far. Normally it will operate just fine if my iPhone is far away within the house or I leave it at home. But occasionally the watch seems to spend quite a bit of time figuring out it can't talk to the iPhone and needs to switch to WiFi or cellular as appropriate. The delay can be on the order of 10 seconds which is more than enough to be highly annoying. I'd rather it err on being more aggressive in connecting on it's own.</li>
    <li>Health: Sometimes it would take me more than a minute on my Series 0 watch to start a workout. It was incredibly frustrating to have it lock up while trying to do so. Naturally it works perfectly now. The heart info feeds into AutoSleep and my workouts but I have no known heart issues so I can't speak to the other features. Also, I haven't fallen...</li>
    <li>CARROT: I'm a long time fan of the app and on the Series 4 it is a delight. I paid for the upgrade so I can use it's complications on my watch faces.</li>
    <li>1Password: I sync a few credit cards, library card and my drivers' license info. Essentially this is "I forgot my wallet" mode.</li>
    <li>Radarscope: Because it's cool to have a weather radar on your wrist! It works well on a Series 4.</li>
    <li>Apps: I do have 24 apps installed but other than those noted above nothing else is particularly remarkable (e.g. Yelp, Hilton).</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As chief technolust-er, procurement officer, and father of a couple of growing kids I have been thinking a lot about the optimal technology plan as our computers pass 5 years of age and the kids break into their teenage years. It used to feel like we needed a couple of computers plus iPads (not to mention phones and gaming consoles). I&rsquo;ve begun to question this assumption quite seriously but have found it difficult to come to a conclusion &ndash; partly because the kids&rsquo; preferences are mercurial and also the future demands of school work are unpredictable (e.g. our daughter is pursuing the digital animation track in HS).</p>

<p>I decided to find a simpler elephant to eat, at least for now, and sat down and enumerated the tasks that drive me to use a Mac vs an iOS device. First up the list of &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be done on my iPad&rdquo; items.</p>

<ul>
    <li>I use the <a href="https://www.iggsoftware.com/banktivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banktivity </a>budgeting and finance management app. It has a richly featured iPad version that I use heavily. Unfortunately the iPad version is missing the full custom reporting package found on macOS. I only need to check these custom reports once or twice a month, and create new ones rarely, but it is a barrier to completely leaving a Mac behind.</li>
    <li>Income tax preparation. I use TurboTax because I don‚Äôt trust doing it online and want to ensure I have the full ability to run it locally in the future.</li>
    <li>Video processing/rendering (it's slow enough on my MBP)</li>
    <li>Major Photo editing projects. There are a lot of great photo editing apps for iOS but I find them slow when dealing with large and RAW images. It's OK when processing one or two but I don't have enough time or patience for doing a large project using iOS apps.</li>
    <li>Software and electronics development projects</li>
    <li>A few random forms and web sites which don‚Äôt work properly on mobile Safari (can't believe companies can't get this right)</li>
    <li>A couple of server processes (though these are no longer indispensable)</li>
</ul>

<p>And now the list of &ldquo;could be done on my iPad but not as easily&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Heavy duty spreadsheet work. I spend a fair amount of effort managing investments and our financial plan. By way of example the Numbers spreadsheet that covers most of this has around 10 different tabs most filled with wide tables. I can do simple updates and tweaks on with my 10" iPad Pro but the screen just isn't wide enough to permit simultaneous clarity of the details while at the same time enabling an effective big picture view. I've contemplated if the larger iPad Pro would be sufficient but I'm not sure. Added context: I have a wide screen monitor on my MBP.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>This one is a bit of a "to be determined" but I've long used Photos on the Mac to create our Christmas Cards and Calendars. Given Apple's decision I imagine this will become more difficult on the Mac. I have yet to explore options on my iPad so I'm not sure if the Mac will still have a clear advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a useful exercise for me. The &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be done on iPad&rdquo; list, though lengthy, is almost entirely comprised of activities I do infrequently. The only outlier is software and electronics development projects which tend to have me at a Mac throughout a day or a few days. The conclusion for me is I don&rsquo;t need a Mac any more. I can share a decent Mac with the kids.</p>

<p>N.B. No actual elephants were harmed in the writing of this post. üêò</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/09/24/120932.html">Why I‚Äôm (Still) using Micro.blog</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ronguest.net/2018/09/24/120932.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-09-24 06:09:32 -0600">Sep 24, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There have been some posts recently from a few respected micro.blog users about leaving the service. The concerns they&rsquo;ve expressed are certainly valid and I&rsquo;ve previously raised nearly all of them to Manton myself. I too gave serious consideration to leaving a few months ago so I thought I&rsquo;d summarize for my own future reference some of the factors that influenced my decision to remain. To be clear this is not a post meant to disagree with anyone. We can see the same issues and come to different conclusions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The number one reason is the excellent ratio of interesting people and posts to noise and hostility [footnote title=...]For this stage in its growth I feel micro.blog has reasonable tools for managing noise and hostility in my timeline and is working to maintain community[/footnote]</li>
    <li>Early on I switched from using micro.blog hosting to self-hosting Wordpress on my droplet so I solidly own my content [footnote title=...]Partly because I do want to truly own my own content and don't see Github pages as viable and partly because early on the apps lacked sufficient features[/footnote]</li>
    <li>I am an iOS user so supported apps do actually exist [footnote title=...]I can fall back on Wordpress on the rare occasion that's necessary. I don‚Äôt trust the 3rd party apps, so far, because I prefer a settled workflow.[/footnote]</li>
    <li>The backend service and apps are evolving in a direction that generally feels right to me</li>
    <li>I hope in some way my presence can help micro.blog evolve and become a useful service for a significant number of people. I‚Äôm getting more out of it than I‚Äôm putting in. [footnote title=...]I don‚Äôt think the service should try to be for everyone or every need. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with serving a useful niche at scale.[/footnote]</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over my hardware wishes for WWDC. The order is based on what I&rsquo;d jump at the chance to buy.</p>

<ol>
    <li>A soundbar version of HomePod (not I chance, I fear)</li>
    <li>A super powerful Mac Mini at least on par with a top end (non-Pro) iMac (failing that, I don't care if they update it at all)</li>
    <li>New 10" scale iPad Pro with Face recognition and general upgrades (I'm ready to hand down mine to one of the kids). Extra points for a new keyboard with an ESC key.</li>
    <li>An iMac update with large SSDs at cheaper price points and with more powerful graphics GPUs</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ll also note updated MacBook Pros with improved keyboards though I don&rsquo;t plan to buy one any time soon. I&rsquo;m not convinced the currently shipping ones have a huge problem but I&rsquo;d like Apple to put this grousing to bed.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen a fair amount of discussion about using Wordpress in a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> fashion[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]Much of the below will probably sound like gibberish if you are unfamiliar with IndieWeb[/footnote]. I set up my self-hosted Wordpress site in January and for my own benefit I thought I&rsquo;d document the Plugins I&rsquo;m using. I&rsquo;d also be interested in feedback on how I could improve it. I really had no idea what I was doing when I set this up.
<h2>Plugins I Set up Specifically for IndieWeb</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/activate-update-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activate Update Services</a>
<ul>
    <li>This plugin carries a warning that it has not been tested with the past 3 major Wordpress versions. My blog is hosted on my multisite Wordpress installation which for some unknown reason removes the ability to configure a host to ping. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services#WordPress_Multisite_Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See this for reference</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-emojis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disable Emojis</a>
<ul>
    <li>Probably bad form to start the list with one that is arguably not IndieWeb oriented but totally required. In spite of the name what this plugin does is enable real emojis in Wordpress posts (otherwise Wordpress replaces emojis with crappy images that look like they were created 20 years ago or so)</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieAuth</a>
<ul>
    <li>I installed this so I have the option of posting from <a href="https://quill.p3k.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quill</a>. It turns my Wordpress into an IndieAuth authorization endpoint. I recently <a href="https://david.shanske.com/2018/04/18/an-indieweb-podcast-episode-2-indieauth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listened to a podcast</a> from <a href="https://david.shanske.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Shanske</a> about this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWeb</a>
<ul>
    <li>Helps you establish your IndieWeb identity by extending the user profile to provide rel-me and¬†h-card fields and optionally adding widgets to display these. It also links to a number of other useful plugins (you can choose if you want any of those or not).</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetPack</a>
<ul>
    <li>Another plugin that is arguably not IndieWeb related but properly processing markdown syntax is mandatory IMO and this does it well. It has a ton of other features that I don&rsquo;t use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/micropub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micropub</a>
<ul>
    <li>I installed this to enable <a href="https://quill.p3k.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quill</a>. It¬†implements the open API standard that is used to create posts on one‚Äôs own domain using third-party clients.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks/">Semantic-Linkbacks</a>
<ul>
    <li>Does just what the name implies: it provides semantic linkbacks for WebMentions, Trackbacks and Pingbacks</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/">WebMention</a>
<ul>
    <li>Another plugin that does what it says adding WebMention support to Wordpress</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/">WebSub/PubSubHubbub</a>
<ul>
    <li>An implementation of the WebHub spec for letting the world know when my blog is updated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>XML-RPC OC (I got directly from <a href="https://micro.blog/colinwalker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colin Walker</a>)
<ul>
    <li>Without this plugin posts sent to my blog via XML-RPC can&rsquo;t be commented on. The OC stands for &ldquo;Open Comments&rdquo; which is exactly what it does</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Plugins I&rsquo;m Using</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">Aksimet</a> Anti-spam (pretty standard)</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/broken-link-checker/">Broken Link Checker</a>
<ul>
    <li>I installed this when I imported posts from one of my old Wordpress sites and wanted to try to clean up or remove broken links in those posts[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]there were a lot[/footnote]. I&rsquo;ve left it running. I may disable it soon because it generates false alerts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/inline-footnotes/">Inline Footnotes</a>
<ul>
    <li>I use this to include asides, snide comments, or additional detail on longer blog posts without cluttering up the main flow of the text. There are a couple in this post.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-category-excluder/">Ultimate Category Excluder</a>
<ul>
    <li>This plugin allows me to identify certain post types that should not be published outside my blog. E.g. a post with an excluded category won&rsquo;t be sent to Micro.blog or Twitter. For my longer posts[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]like this one[/footnote] I prefer to hand-craft and post a separate short/micro-blog entry letting folks know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a> - Backup/Restore (free version)
<ul>
    <li>Backs up my Wordpress files to the Cloud</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/">Wordfence Security</a> (free version)
<ul>
    <li>Provides a level of protection for the site as well as notifications of suspicious activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></p>

<ul>
    <li>I no longer use the web UI or Tweetbot</li>

    <li>I think I'll stop cross-posting soon and stopped posting directly several weeks ago</li>
    <li>I've asked several companies to make their important tweets available via RSS feeds. We'll see.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>I no longer post anything to FB</li>
    <li>I left most groups including the Mac Power User's Podcast group. If they ever switch to a more traditional forum system I'd be interested.</li>
    <li>...but I still have to check the app periodically since the schools and HOA communicate over FB and a few family members post news as well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Instagram</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>I've stopped posting here</li>
    <li>If there was an ability to cross post out of the box I might do that selectively but I am not willing to put any effort into it</li>
    <li>I've un-followed many accounts but still check in periodically</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Flickr</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>I used to be a heavy user. If they restore it as a viable social media option with a photography slant I'd be interested.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least<strong> Micro.blog</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>I'm on the cross-posting plan as some of the limitations of their hosting and apps remain a significant issue for me - I'm hosting my own Wordpress site</li>
    <li>That said, I'm quite happy with the community. I'll lose contact with a number of folks as part of the transition from the other platforms but I'm focusing here for social type interactions. It's worth it.</li>
    <li>Very happy that Manton no longer sees the world as flat (i.e. square photos bias)</li>

			 <p>I recently adopted Feedbin to read RSS feeds as well as for reading posts from people/companies I follow on Twitter. That latter feature has been a revelation and showed how messed up Twitter‚Äôs ‚Äútimeline‚Äù approach is. The accounts I follow on Twitter fall into a few broad categories: people I know well (family, friends, close colleagues), finance &amp; investing professionals, and news accounts (mostly tech news). The way the Twitter timeline blindly mashes a bunch of completely unrelated posts together was quite jarring to me (though I didn‚Äôt realize it until now) and always put me in the ‚Äúscan through quickly‚Äù mode that really hampered any real engagement or absorption of what people were saying.</p>

<p>Using Feedbin each account‚Äôs posts are separated. So a couple of times a day I put on my ‚Äúmoney hat‚Äù and delve into the feeds on finance and investing where I can deep drive right away (browser-based) on anything of interest. The same for my feeds (Twitter and RSS) in the other categories. It probably sounds like such a simple (or obvious?) thing but I really am getting much more out of the info being posted.</p>

<p>Twitter lists could have been used to group categories like this together but the UI would still be very cluttered and there is no integration with RSS feeds. Plus I always found managing the lists so much trouble I never maintained them.</p>

<p>Our local fave sushi place is owned by a great Sushi master chef and his wife. We aren‚Äôt into rolls etc, for us it is all about the raw fish quality and variety and they are amazingly consistent. Rather surprisingly in addition to being great with sushi the owner is also a master baker. Our daughter loves his Japanese style strawberry cake. It is light and not sweet - he lets the strawberries speak for themselves and the layers have lovely strawberry halves throughout (just as lovely as the ones on top). <br /><br />It‚Äôs become something of a tradition to order her a whole cake for her birthday and this year was no exception. This isn‚Äôt something they normally do so requests must be made well in advance. When my wife sent the text asking for the cake she included the message she wanted written on the top and ended it with <em>tyvm</em> (as in thank you very much). Apparently the distinction was lost as they included that on the cake as well as the message to the amusement of all concerned.<br /><br />N.B. he makes the best creme br√ªl√©e I‚Äôve ever eaten.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently responded to several people asking variations on the question of whether they should get an Apple Watch. It has been a thought provoking exercise as I face a dilemma on whether to replace mine.</p>

<p>I have a series 0 Apple Watch. When the AW[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]Apple Watch[/footnote] was announced I was lukewarm but ended up having major orthopedic surgery with a long recovery period. I really felt a fitness device would help motivate me to recover as quickly as possible and was most interested in the AW since I felt if I was going to spend money it might as well be on something multifunction[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]instead of something like a Fitbit[/footnote]. The AW completely lived up to my expectations in this regard and definitely aided my recovery - enough to justify the cost on this basis alone.</p>

<p>Before I got the AW I had stopped wearing watches altogether even though I have a few nice ones[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;] including some with sentimental value but these days having a clock on a wrist seems redundant[/footnote]. On the few special occasions I&rsquo;ve worn one I always scolded the old-school watch for being nearly useless. It&rsquo;s basically a piece of static jewelry rather than a useful device[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I&rsquo;m not much into jewelry&hellip;[/footnote]. I glance at my¬†AW and immediately see a very clear display of the date and time[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]no matter the lighting conditions[/footnote], the status of my 3 fitness rings, an at-a-glance view of upcoming meetings, and the current and forecast weather for the day. Some of the situational features I find very useful are the abilities to answer (often reject) phone calls at a glance, to quickly make simple responses to text messages, and to control my music selections and volume during workouts. I value not needing to pull my phone out of my pocket to keep up with life.</p>

<p>Here is what&rsquo;s bothering me - the battery situation. Mine is degrading to the point it is iffy if it will last the whole day. A couple of days ago it went into power reserve mode before 8pm. A battery replacement would cost $80 nearly 25% the cost of a replacement watch. Do I really want to pay to replace the watch every 3 years[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I consider the battery replacement a bad investment because the series 0 is so friggin slow&hellip;[/footnote]? It&rsquo;s not a matter of affordability so I am not sure why this bothers me so much nor do I know what I&rsquo;m going to ultimately decide. I guess it is a techie&rsquo;s dilemma and partly a holdover based on an outmoded idea of watches.</p>

			 <p>Rather innocently I purchased a simple Network Attached Storage device to perform a couple of simple chores. Little did I know it would quickly turn into a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hydra-Greek-mythology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hydra</a> poking itself into niches all around our home.¬†I could have saved myself trouble and likely a fair mount of money in the long run if I had realized this thing had a secret plan to take over the world (ok, just my network).</p>

<p>Over the years we outgrew our previous network backup solutions which initially relied on AirPort Extreme + an external HDD and evolved into an iMac running MacOS Server providing a network Time Machine destination[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]both both became very unreliable over time[/footnote]. The iMac was also our Network Video Recorder (NVR) using the <a href="http://www.bensoftware.com/securityspy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Spy</a> software package. Along the way our daughter started monetizing her YouTube videos and all at once the iMac was overloaded from both a CPU and HDD storage standpoint.</p>

<p>I decided it was time for a purpose-built device for network backups and to record the video from our security cameras. My needs seemed modest: backup a few Macs and record video from a couple of cameras. Surely I had no need for a high end device and no need for a ton of storage. I bought a NAS[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]a Synology <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS418play" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ds416play</a>[/footnote] and a couple of Seagate drives and had the NAS up and running quickly. But then it happened. Some serious feature-creep snuck through the backdoor.</p>

<p>After the NAS had been running well for months I started poking around the admin UI and noticed some <del>shiny new playthings</del> additional useful features. At the time our iMac was also our media server using Home Sharing in iTunes to stream music, home videos, DVDs etc. This rarely worked well - it was often necessary to quit and restart iTunes to get the media to show up on our AppleTV or iOS devices and sometimes we even had to reboot the iMac to get it to work[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]Yeah, iTunes software is crap[/footnote]. I had played with <a href="http://www.plex.tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plex Media Server</a> a bit on the iMac and when I saw there was a Plex package for Synology I set that up in what amounted to a single click. A bonus is that Plex on the Synology supports hardware accelerated transcoding of videos. Moving the media files from the iMac to the NAS was painless [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]but time consuming[/footnote]. Getting the media files named in a way that Plex would handle correctly was a big pain in the ass because it works completely differently than iTunes[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]maybe I&rsquo;ll post about that some day[/footnote]. Once I discovered and ran some tools to help with the media naming transition Plex proved to be an awesome media server. Much more reliable than iTunes. So at this stage my little box became a combination of NAS + NVR + <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTPC</a>¬†and I was filling up the empty bays with additional disks. But the invasion wasn&rsquo;t over&hellip;</p>

<p>We have several brands of HomeKit devices for home automation [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]see my <a href="https://ron.theguests.us/tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tools page</a> for more info[/footnote]. The earliest are Belkin WeMo switches which don&rsquo;t work with HomeKit[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]which I would not recommend[/footnote]. I heard of a package called <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HomeBridge</a> which, when running 24/7, added HomeKit support for WeMo. I initially rejected the idea of installing this home-brew package on the NAS since I considered the NAS &ldquo;mission critical&rdquo; for our household. That was until I heard it was possible to run HomeBridge in a¬†<a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker</a>¬†container[footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]Docker is a great piece of IT infrastructure software that makes it easy to run images on top of host OS such as Windows, Linux and MacOS [/footnote]. Installing Docker was quick and easy. Installing HomeBridge was easy as well but configuring it properly was tricky and required quite a bit of trial and error. However once configured HomeBridge provided trouble-free integration of our WeMo devices [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I could now use Siri to open and close my garage door[/footnote]. Time to add one more duty for my little NAS box: now we&rsquo;ve got a 4 headed Hydra with NAS + NVR + HTPC + <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtualization Server</a>.</p>

<p>Docker containers are like potato chips: no one can eat just one. As things stand I have five different containers running on the NAS performing a wide variety of tasks. The great thing is that if one of those crashes it has no effect on the mission critical uses of the NAS [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]and the container will automatically be restarted[/footnote]. I recently began running Apache on the NAS to serve up files formerly hosted on my <a href="http://digitalocean.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Ocean</a> VPS [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]these are consumed by IoT custom devices at home and accessing them became problematic when I further locked down my VPS[/footnote]. So at this point I had managed to bring to life the 9 headed Hydra of legend: a NAS + NVR + HTPC + Virtualization Server <strong>x</strong> 5 + Web Server.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really pleased with the <a href="http://synology.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synology</a> NAS. It is very easy to manage and very cost competitive versus the home-brew devices I&rsquo;ve seen spec&rsquo;d for doing anything like this. Mine is serving 9 different uses and doesn&rsquo;t even break a sweat. The CPU has no trouble handling the workload [footnote title=&ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;]I upgraded the RAM from 1GB to 4GB[/footnote]. The lesson learned is I wish I had either gone with larger hard drives or purchased a 5 bay or expandable model. Adding storage capacity to mine would require replacing all 4 HDD or replacing the NAS box with a much more expensive model. So my advice is if you&rsquo;re buying a NAS be sure to realize it may turn out to be much more useful than you imagined and to give yourself healthy room for expansion.</p>

			 <p>My 9 year old son and I just finished building the <a href="https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Old-Fishing-Store-21310">Old Fishing Store</a> that I received as a Christmas gift. It isn‚Äôt that large but since it has a ton of detail there are over 2,000 pieces.  There are two removable roofs allowing access to the rooms inside the store and also two walls that swing open for the same purpose. It is one of the more playable sets, in my opinion, because it comes with a ton of loose accessories such as crabs, lobsters, scuba gear, seagulls, chests with fishing gear, TNT (!?!) and other items.</p>

<p>This Lego set game out of their Ideas program where Lego aficionados design kits out of their own imagination and then submit them for voting by other Lego customers. The top vote-getters earn the right to be turned into real Lego kits. The man who dreamed up this kit did a great job.

			 <p>When Apple first introduced Live photos I thought they were just a gimmick - a bit of flash for some marketing buzz. After all, almost no one but the owner would ever see the live version, right? Fast forward a couple of years and I needed a new phone and after holding one at an Apple store I splurged for an iPhone X for Christmas.  A couple days later we leave for a vacation and it happens‚Ä¶ a complete 180 degree turn in my opinion. Why you may ask?</p>

<p>Live Photos are an amazing way to capture the <strong>perfect</strong> moment when photographing an individual or group. Remember how often someone&rsquo;s expression is just slightly off, or they have just started to blink and their eyes aren&rsquo;t completely open? Live Photos capture a few seconds in time and based on taking a few hundred photos on the trip are amazingly effective at capturing those ‚Äújust right‚Äù expressions. All you need to do is scan through each frame of the Live Photo and pick the right key frame.</p>

<p>I also discovered another thing about Live Photos. There can be a lot of humor captured in those few seconds as people start to mug for the camera or relax just after they think the photo is done. I found value in Live Photos even in landscape photos (e.g. at the beach). Those few seconds are often the prefect amount of time to capture a wave crashing on the beach or trees rustling in a forest - without the hassle of starting and stopping a movie capture. It just seems more natural and it really encourages short snippets of motion. At least for me, I always hated to fire up the video mode unless I was recording something that took awhile. It all sounds great, right, <strong>but</strong> ‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Apple in one of those odd decisions it makes provides no way to really leverage and share the motion captured in Live Photos. I was incredibly frustrated by this because many of the Live Photos I captured on the trip would have made a great video when stitched together. I did some searching for an iOS app to help and all the ones I found initially were lacking. Then, by some miracle, one of the women I follow on Twitter retweeted a request from <a href="https://micro.blog/becky">@becky</a> for beta testers for an app called <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2018/01/29/snapthread-1-5/">Snapthread</a>. She kindly agreed to add me as a beta tester and at first I wasn&rsquo;t sure I could pull off my project with the app. I feared I was still going to have to jump through the hoops to get them all into iMovie - not something I looked forward to at all. But I made a few suggestions to <a href="https://micro.blog/becky">@becky</a> which she implemented virtually over night and viola I had the perfect iOS app for creating videos out of stitched together Live Photos. In fact Snapthread worked so well I integrated some movies taken from the trip with the Live Photos. When it was all said and done I and created 48 clips in Snapthread (from a few seconds to a few minutes)! Becky&rsquo;s app allowed me to quickly create and share memories from our vacation in a way just having some photos or videos could never have accomplished. And all made using my iPhone. Thank you Becky! Obviously I highly recommend <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2018/01/29/snapthread-1-5/">Snapthread</a> and Becky is absolutely justified in saying this is the best app for combining and sharing Live Photos.</p>

			 <p>I was aware Adafruit had a standard camera that works with Arduino over serial but I discovered yesterday they have a¬†<a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/613" target="_blank">Weatherproof¬†version¬†with infrared LEDs</a> to support night vision. I&rsquo;m planning to get one in the near future and give it a try with the Yun. In theory it should be compatible. One particularly cool thing is it has motion detection built into the camera itself. I&rsquo;m a bit skeptical of how well this works as there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to control what part of the image is used for motion detection nor a way to adjust sensitivity. I suspect it will detect a lot of spurious motion. But I&rsquo;m willing to give it a try.</p>

Not only is it petite and highly functional it is cute as well. A great Arduino for small installations and when you need to fit a bunch in a small space. One thing to keep in mind is it lacks USB for programming so you need a FTDI breakout. Keep Making!</p>

			 <p>The Arduino team just announced the Arduino Due board and software are live. You can check the <a href="http://store.arduino.cc/ww/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=11&amp;products_id=243" target="_blank">details on their site</a>. The Due board is the first to use a 32-bit ARM processor, as two USB connectors, and 54 digital I/O pins. Quite a bit of power for not much money!</p>

			 <p>Time for my second iPad app recommendation.¬†Flipboard seems to get all the love yet, while I do use it, I find myself looking at Zite much more often. While Flipboard is source oriented, Zite manages personalization using topics. This generally works well and provides a more diverse mix of stories than Flipboard. Zite takes personalization another step further by allowing you to give a thumbs up or down to a story to help guide which ones it presents to you in the future. You can also indicate a preference for certain sources as you page through stories.</p>

<p>Navigation is easy and the usual methods of sharing stories present. I like it&rsquo;s Twitter integration better than some apps because it uses what you&rsquo;ve configured in Twitter on the iPad. I have a couple of Twitter accounts and Zite lets me pick which one to post to on each share.</p>

			 <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve been living with my iPad 2 for a few weeks I&rsquo;ve settled on some favorite apps. The first I&rsquo;ll mention is the <a href="http://www.echofon.com" target="_blank">Echofon</a> twitter client. I&rsquo;m using the lite version on all my devices (Mac, iPhone and iPad - they also have a Windows version). The Lite version has ads but they&rsquo;re not intrusive (to me&hellip;). One of the best features is Echofon syncs read status across all the platforms. So if I read a tweet on my iPad and then open up Echofon on my Mac I won&rsquo;t see some huge number of unread tweets. And it will scroll to the point in the timeline with the unseen tweets. I use a couple of Twitter accounts and Echofon handles that just fine on all the platforms.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2012/01/03/000359.html">Smoking Hot: AT&amp;#038;T 4G LTE Hotspot (Elevate)</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://ronguest.net/2012/01/03/000359.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2012-01-03 18:03:59 -0600">Jan 3, 2012</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last month I decided to get a Mifi/Mobile hotspot device and went with the <a title="Elevate" href="http://www.wireless.att.com/businesscenter/devices/mobile-hotspot-elevate-4g.jsp" target="_blank">AT&amp;T Elevate</a>. It&rsquo;s a 4G LTE device (or at least claims to deliver LTE speed). I&rsquo;ve played with it for a few weeks and have noticed everything seems snappier when I&rsquo;m on the Elevate when compared to Wifi on my home Uverse network. So I ran a series of tests with the Speedtest app and the two screenshots are representative of the results. Pretty impressive&hellip;</p>

<p>This first screenshot shows typical results with an iPad connected to my home Wifi. Respectable download speed (I&rsquo;m on a fairly cheap rate plan) but as always Uverse upload speed totally sucks.</p>

<p>Below is the result using my iPad connected to the Elevate. Damn impressive as it is 40% faster for downloading and more than 3x faster for uploads. Note for these tests the Elevate was showing a single bar of signal strength.</p>

<p>So if I really need to do something in a hurry I&rsquo;ll be sure I&rsquo;ve connected to my Elevate. The service plan includes 5GB in the base fee. Fairly generous but certainly means I can&rsquo;t use the Elevate full time.</p>

<p>Ars Technica has a post up on the new (free) &ldquo;Find my Friends&rdquo; app for iOS 5 - and it is very well done as is their norm. And it shows once again how Apple is taking user privacy much more seriously than Google.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been unwilling to use Google&rsquo;s Latitude but the level of control in Apple&rsquo;s app is enough to make me comfortable. Will I use it? I&rsquo;m not so sure about that simply because I don&rsquo;t see a benefit from doing so. Even with &ldquo;local&rdquo; friends close usually means 30 minutes or more apart. I&rsquo;ll probably try it out for awhile as an experiment.</p>

<p>Cisco Systems Wednesday announced new technology to deliver high-definition video and voice through a virtual desktop infrastructure which sends the signals from one endpoint to the other, bypassing the data center and reducing the high CPU processing and bandwidth that makes for subpar video. Cisco is also entering into a &ldquo;strategic alliance&rdquo; with virtual desktop provider Citrix to tightly integrate the Cisco technology, called Virtual Experience Infrastructure VXI with the Citrix XenDesktop virtual desktop platform.</p>

<p>The price and specs mentioned on Amazon¬†<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Color-Multi-touch-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B0051VVOB2/ref=amb_link_357575542_4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=gateway-center-column&amp;pf_rd_r=0NRF2NRCHMSKV4DJP19D&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1321408942&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Kindle Fire - Full Color Kindle with 7&rdquo; Multi-Touch Display, Wi-Fi</a>¬†are indeed impressive. The price came in a bit lower than I expected. A real verdict will have to wait for detailed hands-on reviews but as I mentioned in this prior post I believe the Fire will be the second highly successful tablet. In fact it should outsell iPads unless Apple comes up with a lower priced model soon. I definitely see this as a candidate tablet for my kids. It&rsquo;s bound to be on a ton of Christmas lists&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/27/disney-to-pair-ipad-physical-toys-with-new-games/" target="_blank">TUAW</a> is reporting that Disney will soon launch a set of physical toys that interact directly with iPads. Apparently this will be something of a scroller game where the landscape will scroll by and the child (in all of us?) interacts by moving a car over the surface of the iPad.</p>

<p>While the description provided doesn&rsquo;t seem very compelling I&rsquo;m very interested in learning more about the technology used in the cars. I&rsquo;m a big believer in the growth of physical interaction with computing devices. In spite of this incarnation seeming a bit lame I think we will soon see some exciting innovations. And that 32-bit Arduino will likely be in the middle of things&hellip;</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>At the New York Make Faire this month the Arduino team, led by Massimo Banzi, made some exciting announcements. The first was the release candidate for the IDE/sketch system. Yes it has finally reached Arduino 1.0rc stage and <a title="1.0 rc" href="http://code.google.com/p/arduino/wiki/Arduino1" target="_blank">you can get it here</a> if you want an early look. As you&rsquo;ll see from the announcement video linked below this should go final in the next month or two.</p>

<p>The biggest excitement comes from the new hardware they&rsquo;ve introduced. Here are a few highlights along with a photo of the spec sheet.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Arduino Leonardo - a lower cost Uno with a simpler design but, get this, it has USB capabilities built in. It can handily emulate USB devices such as a mouse or keyboard. It's expected cost about $20US.</li>
    <li>Arduino Wifi Shield - finally an official, and far superior, Wifi shield is coming. I've experimented with several of the existing Wifi shields and their implementation all leave something (in fact a lot) to be desired. This official shield, coming soon for about $80US, will leverage support in the new Arduino 1.0 software as well as benefitting from a design that avoids the UART. This means it's functioning will be completely hackable. It has it's own processor so performance will also be superior as well. The Wifi shield should be available soon - but I won't be surprised if they sell out immediately.</li>
    <li>Arduino Due - a Arduino with a 32-bit processor but that barely tells the tale on this one as it's I/O performance will kick some serious butt. This baby is due at the end of 2011 and will clearly push the frontiers of what's possible with an Arduino.</li>
    <li>Arduino Robot System - this is a dual-Arduino robot system which is TinkerKit compatible. I have not yet seen a release date for this one.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I highly recommend reading this blog post by Roger Nusbaum if you have given or are giving thoughts to your retirement plan. Before the baby boomers neared retirement the US was in a fairly high growth state. Rising home and equity values, combined with nice returns on cash/bond investments, made it easy to accumulate retirement funds while still spending fairly heavily. Things have changed for the worse and won&rsquo;t get better for many years (think a decade or more). Growth is slow in all developed countries with interest rates far below the level needed to deliver a real return above inflation. House values are likely to recover in the next few years but the steady long term growth will not return. Some Asian economies are in a position to grow faster than developed ones but are far too small to sustain the global economy in the face of European and North American long term weakness. It all sounds quite negative but if you plan accordingly you can still earn nice returns and retire at a reasonable age. Act and succeed.</p>

			 <p>Amazon&rsquo;s rumored Android-based tablet is nearing release and more details are leaking out. Without knowing details it isn&rsquo;t possible to come to a conclusion but on speculation I&rsquo;d say this is the first tablet that could present any sort of real competition to Apple&rsquo;s iPad, especially given the price point. Of all the companies trying to tackle the iPad Amazon is the only one that can come close to Apple&rsquo;s ecosystem appeal. It will still be a second rate device but should attract a solid customer base and, like Apple, generate an ongoing source of revenue as users purchase content, sign up for Amazon Prime, etc.</p>

<p>What do you think? Has real innovation stalled? If you disagree I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing why you disagree. And please, don&rsquo;t use Apple as your only counter-point&hellip;</p>

<p>I personally believe he is correct. We&rsquo;re iterating quickly on technologies that were new when I was in college. But the iterations are just that - improvements in how we make use of those technologies not truly new innovations. Is this a natural lull, part of an ebb and flow for results? Or a true decline?</p>

<p>Google+ has potential. One of the biggest needs is to quickly get a critical mass of users (hey, that means YOU need to join). If that happens and Twitter indeed starts cramming ads down my throat in the timelines I&rsquo;m sure Twitter will be the one I drop (keeping FaceBook as well).</p>

			 <p>Lytro has developed a technology to allow you to select the focus point in photographs after taking a photo. This isn&rsquo;t a sharpening technique but instead is a fundamental capture of light field information that allows amazing post-processing results. What&rsquo;s really cool is the company states this technology can be applied to virtually any camera technology including smartphones and point &amp; shoot cameras. They&rsquo;re planning to introduce their first camera by the end of the year and ultimately license the technology. They&rsquo;re claiming cameras with their technology will be competitively priced. It will require a new image format for the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; data and specialized post-processing software. Still, this will be some amazing tech if it lives up to the hype.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A prior post talked about a lightweight and reliable method for sending push notifications from an Arduino to a mobile phone. In this post I&rsquo;ll to describe my application for the notifications.</p>

<p>When looking for project inspiration I saw a couple of designs for monitoring a postal mailbox and sending a notification when the door was opened (e.g. when you get new mail). Those didn&rsquo;t seem very useful but they did tickle a notion I&rsquo;ve had of knowing if my garage door was left open for a period of time. I see this happen regularly in our neighborhood and it sometimes results in the loss of bicycles, tools and once even a car. In the spirit of truth-in-posting we once left ours open all night. Fortunately nothing was taken. Now on to the build&hellip;</p>

<p>The parts list, other than a basic pullup resistor and some wire, is pretty short and consists of</p>

<ul>
    <li><a> " target="_blank"&gt;Arduino Uno</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9954" target="_blank">WiFly WiFi Shield</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10088" target="_blank">Arduino Project Enclosure</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8269" target="_blank">Arduino Wall Adapter</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10001_10001_588131_-1" target="_blank">Magnetic Proximity Sensor</a>, and</li>
    <li>A pair of <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103982" target="_blank">Screw Terminals</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms the goal of the project is to send me an alert if the door is open longer than a specified period of time (e.g. 15 minutes) and to send me an update if the door closes after that time period. Quite simple eh? I also implemented a &ldquo;health check&rdquo; that enables the Arduino to ping my server periodically. A script runs on the server and if it doesn&rsquo;t hear from the Arduino it too will send an alert letting me know there has been a monitoring failure. After all what good is a security device that fails silently?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in a project like this let me know and I can give you the source code (sketch).</p>

			 <p>Although I&rsquo;m surely in the camp of folks who&rsquo;d love unlimited high-speed Mobile data (3G/4G/LTE/&hellip;) for the rest of my life I recognize that isn&rsquo;t a viable business model. ¬†Although Wifi service is also becoming metered the offered capacities and performance at a given cost are superior. It simply costs less to provide a specific level of service using this type of technology than using Mobile spectrums. Not only is the up front cost lower but the ongoing costs of keeping up with new technology is lower as well (i.e. upgrade costs). Time to market is another issue as AT&amp;T has publicly stated multiple times one of the reasons they can&rsquo;t keep up with demand is the inability to gain rights to add new cell sites or upgrade existing ones. We should ultimately expect a Wifi descendant to be our primary &ldquo;un-wired&rdquo; technology with Mobile spectrum providing service when we are &ldquo;in the gap&rdquo; between Wifi connections.</p>

<p>Wifi investment would be climbing rapidly now except for one thing - much of the public Wifi infrastructure is owned by, yes you guessed it, companies like AT&amp;T who are presently milking Mobile users for as much money as ¬†they can. It&rsquo;s the Mobile data users who are propping up their revenue stream as legacy technologies erode. They don&rsquo;t have much incentive to wean users from expensive Mobile data plans hence they currently only favor Wifi in places like Times Square and Super Bowl venues where Mobile spectrum is utterly unable to deal with the demand.</p>

<p>But as I stated in the opening, the relative infrastructure costs will ultimately cause them to switch horses.</p>

			 <p>The article from TechCrunch details the findings of a British developer who inadvertently discovered a great way to exploit expired domains to gain access to a person or company&rsquo;s email accounts and other online services. This very simple technique, which requires no hacking at all, can easily yield access to Amazon accounts and banking services. Google and other companies really need to raise the bar to make it more difficult for people to claim email accounts and service accounts.</p>

			 <p>It is good to know there is a Bluetooth solution to the odd lack of GPS functionality on Wifi-only iPads. The device is a great size and the review is pretty positive. But at $99 list it would make more sense to buy a Wifi+3G iPad model instead. However if you bought the Wifi model not knowing GPS didn&rsquo;t work I suppose this would be a slightly cheaper solution than ¬†trading up to a 3G model.</p>

			 <p>I needed to spend some time last night exploring the source to the library that comes with the SparkFun WiFly device. In the process I discovered why it wasn&rsquo;t possible to use the library&rsquo;s code to join a WiFi network if the SSID has a space in the name (even if you used a $ substitution). It is not quite the fault of the library code as the root cause is that one form of the join command on the chip won&rsquo;t accept a space/$. The good news is by changing the code in the library slightly I could get the $ substituted SSID name to work just fine. I&rsquo;ve posted details on the <a href="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=28163" target="_blank">SparkFun forum</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">My current annoyance is that the Arduino's official Ethernet library derives from Stream but the WiFly library derives from Print meaning third party libraries and code that work with Ethernet can't be used with the WiFly without quite a bit of work. I need to dive in further to understand if the WiFly library could be modified. I'm not sure why the library's author deviated in such a fundamental way from the standard library.¬†</p>

			 <p>As I previously mentioned I got a <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9954" target="_blank">WiFly shield </a>from SparkFun in order to connect my Arduino to the Internet. It is a nifty little board but I immediately ran into problems getting it to join my wireless network. I&rsquo;ll skip the fits and starts in my journey to diagnosis and troubleshoot a solution and instead jump to my conclusion.</p>

<p>But first some relevant bits about my WiFi network. I&rsquo;m using WPA for security and my router publishes two SSIDs. One is the main network and another is a &ldquo;guest&rdquo; network with limited access and a different SSID. The main SSID has one space in the name while the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; SSID has two and is longer. In fact the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; SSID is 26 characters in length.</p>

<p>I initially tried to connect the WiFly to the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; SSID using example code included with the WiFly library. This failed with no error - in fact the example code hung at the point where it called &ldquo;join&rdquo;. After sending commands directly to the chip I found I could not join when using the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; SSID name. However I could join if I did a &ldquo;scan&rdquo; command and then sent a &ldquo;join&rdquo; command specifying the index number in the scan output. This was my main clue that the SSID name was the problem. Conclusion: either 26 characters for the SSID is too long or the chip cannot handle two spaces in the SSID name.</p>

<p>I next tried to join the main SSID using the example code and this too failed. However in this case I could successfully join this SSID by sending the commands to the chip and so I could conclude one space in the SSID was no problem (you do substitute a $ for the space). Reading the source code for the WiFly library I found a &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; comment to support spaces and hence I&rsquo;m confident the library does not support spaces. I added code to set the SSID, bypassing the library&rsquo;s code, and could then use the library to execute the join and access the internet successfully.</p>

<p>The code I used was a snippet from a post by Gary on this S<a href="http://forum.sparkfun.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=25129" target="_blank">parkFun Forum thread</a>. If you have questions feel free to comment. In spite of the problems with the library, and potentially the chip having limitations on the SSID, I think this is a nifty little shield and I&rsquo;m anxious to start some new projects involving connectivity.</p>

			 <p>Sony has finally come clean on the full scale of the breach in the Playstation Network. It is enormous in scale and more than just an inconvenience to gamers. The hacker was able to get everything needed to launch identity theft on 70 million, yes MILLION, users. I&rsquo;m in the business of enterprise IT including security and the majority of the breaches I see are the result of unpatched systems or lax administration. The breadth and depth of this baby shows the fundamental design of the Playstation Network had one, and like a whole list, of critical security flaws. Far too much information was exposed than necessary. Companies need to learn to not cut corners on the secure <strong>design</strong> of systems that store our critical information. No amount of patching will fix these kind of design flaws.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">I'm glad I don't use the Playstation Network. And encourage you to do as I do - never let a merchant store your credit card info for future use. For sites that insist on storing one, such as those that do auto-renewals, I simply obtain a one time use number from my credit card company. The number has a dollar limit just enough to cover my purchase and will expire in a month which provides additional protection. Since the credit card number isn't my <em>real</em> number it is of little use to a hacker. To avoid the inconvenience of always having to type in my credit card info at merchants I use regularly I find 1Password to be invaluable (and it does a whole lot more to help secure your information).</p>

			 <p>As soon as I got my 11&rdquo; MacBook Air, some months ago now, it was obvious carrying it in any of my existing backpacks or bags would look ridiculous. Rather like my 2 year old walking around in one of my shirts. I was seriously disappointed when I hit up Google to start my search for a case that would meet my requirements. They weren&rsquo;t very complex: thin and sized for the 11&rdquo; MBA, modest amount of padding to protect the diminutive baby, a small pocket to hold my essentials such as a 2 factor USB fob, earphones and so forth. Oh, and it had to be something a male would generally be comfortable carrying. Particularly on Etsy I found a few interesting cases but they were way too feminine in design for my taste. Most cases I found were either nothing more than a slipcase (no pocket) or were too bulky (basically small versions of a backpack). Somewhere in my digging around someone praised this Targus case and since my local BestBuy had it in stock I checked it out.</p>

<p>The Targus slip case is made of neoprene and sized for notebooks of up to 12&rdquo;. In practice the 11&rdquo; MBA has a nice snug fit along the width of this case. I was originally concerned that the height of the case was a couple inches more than that of the MBA. In practice this is actually a nice little feature as it provides a fairly secure grip (almost like a handle). The pocket is a great size. Mine contains a 2 factor USB device, two USB thumb drives, a small pad of paper, pen, earphones and my Bluetooth earpiece.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve carried the case around a lot over the past few months and it shows no signs of wear. Although not as cool looking as I&rsquo;d prefer (an identical case made of leather would be so much nicer) the price and functionality are fantastic. I can easily recommend it if your needs are similar to mine.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">... Sarah Perez's op-ed on ReadWriteWeb pretty well sums up why I don't have any Android devices yet. They seem to perpetually be behind Apple, for my use cases (and maybe not yours), and about the time they're close Apple leaps ahead again. I've used an iPhone for several years now and, if for no other reason than a constant desire for change, would like to change platforms. The rumors regarding a new iPhone seem to point to only a modest update later this year. If so that may be enough for Android to do some major catching up and finally make me consider a change. On the other hand in the tablet space I think Apple is so far ahead I don't see anyone catching them in the next 12 months. And maybe therein lies the cause of the predicted modest update to the iPhone - Apple could be pouring the resources into rapid innovation of the iPad instead.</p>

			 <p>I live in an area where tornados and severe thunderstorms are a regular occurrence. Staying aware of these threats should be a basic part of life but used to entail either being glued to a weather broadcast on TV or constantly checking radar/warnings on a website. Sure, there are sirens outdoors but they can only be heard indoors under ideal conditions. However advances in weather radios and a new tool for iPhones provide a much better proactive notification solutions.</p>

<p>For homes the top solution is a Weather Radio with S.A.M.E. technology. These radios will &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and sound an alarm if a threat occurs and, most importantly, allow you to specify exactly which dangerous conditions will generate the audible alarm. This is key because without it minor alarms can wake you in the middle of the night for no good reason at which point you turn it off an lose the value of having one in the first place. We&rsquo;ve had one for a few years now and it has been reliable in alerting us including several times when we were unaware severe weather was a risk.</p>

<p>More recently I discovered an iPhone app call Weather Alert USA that does much the same thing. It costs a few dollars but is worth it since it means you will get alerts even when running errands, at a sporting event and so forth.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s always good to keep your eyes and ears open when weather threats are around but these tools help ensure you and your family are not caught off-guard.</p>

			 <p>Those who follow me on Twitter or FaceBook know I decided to dive into the world of <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/">Arduino</a> recently. After a bit of studying, ordering parts, and making a few runs to RadioShack I&rsquo;ve completed the prototype build of my first project. The goal is to create a multi-purpose motion detector. The key components of this build are the Arduino microcontroller, a Parallax passive infrared sensor, and a <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=17_21">Adafruit Audio (WAV) shield</a> with a SD card for audio storage. Arduino processors have very little memory so the SD card is essential to play sounds of any complexity or duration.</p>

<p>My current software manages the Infrared sensor, lights a LED when motion is detected and also plays a tone on a piezo device. The Audio shield has pretty low level hardware so the software to manipulate it is relatively complex and will take a little time to integrate. I built the Audio shield last night and tonight I integrated it with the PIR, LED and piezo and tweaked the software that senses motion and manipulates the LED and piezo. My next step will be to add the code needed to play audio from the SD card through a speaker. I suspect once I have that software mod working I will have to design more amplification than the Audio shield provides.</p>

<p>As far as applications for this project: well, you&rsquo;ll have to wait a bit to hear about that. I&rsquo;m planning to create a few postings on the Arduino resources I&rsquo;ve found most useful. The photo below shows the current build with the Audio shield stacked on top of the Arduino Duo with a small breadboard for the misc parts.</p>

Which also means you are trackable regardless of your phone&rsquo;s brand or OS platform. If you really don&rsquo;t want anyone knowing where you are you need to turn your phone off. It is the only real solution at this time. You can partly thank or blame the move to support 911 from cell phones for this situation.</p>

			 <p>RockMelt showed some real potential when it launched last year. I managed to use it full time on both Mac and Windows before some of its limitations became too troublesome (mainly performance issues). A number of my friends followed the same path of adoption for a month or 2 (or 3) followed by disenchantment. RockMelt recently pushed out a major update which I had not gotten around to testing. With the release of an iPhone version I&rsquo;ll probably put this pretty high on my &ldquo;new toys to play with&rdquo; list. Note: no more invitations required so feel free to grab it for a test drive.</p>

			 <p>Not really a surprise Internet advertising rebounded from the slump or that it hit a new record but there are some standout points in the report. The most striking to me is that Email marketing revenues not only fell off a cliff but that it represents just 1% of the market. That&rsquo;s good news and I&rsquo;m sure we all hope it falls further :)</p>

<p>The biggest growth surprise was Sponsorships which were up 88%. IAB didn&rsquo;t start tracking mobile advertising until last year (umm, a bit slow on that one) so there is no YoY comparison. But in 2010 it is estimated to account for about $600 Million (plus or minus a few 10s of millions).</p>

			 <p>I can&rsquo;t completely agree with <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/04/is-the-airport-extreme-worth-the-price/" target="_blank">this review</a> for one simple reason: my Airport Extreme does not run hot. In fact it is quite cool even though it is installed in a small equipment cabinet.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">More seriously I think the review sums up my pre-purchase thinking and after-purchase result. The Extreme has been rock solid since I installed it while providing very good performance to a mixed network of Macs, Wintels, AppleTVs, DirecTVs, iPhones etc. connected using different speeds of WiFi and Ethernet (via various hubs). It is not the most feature-rich but does everything I need and more. Administratively the main complaint I have is it isn't easy to get a list of active devices. Since that's not something I need to do often it's a feature I can easily live without.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Being a techie there are times I love to tinker and reconfigure devices but now that I have a whole family, and family of devices, constantly on the internet I simply want a router that "works" and the Extreme fits the bill perfectly.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been closely following the investigation into Stuxnet and this video is a great introduction. I spent a big chunk of my career creating control systems followed by another chunk creating security products. I can assure you the control system industry, and hence it&rsquo;s customers, are very poorly prepared to deal with any serious attack. Most users, even your average developer, think that addressing a security issue just means putting out a software patch. But those more heavily involved know that in many cases a true fix can require an architectural overhaul - sometimes on a massive scale. Vendors don&rsquo;t undertake this kind of change without massive pressure from their customers and this is completely lacking in this industry. The only way I can see of forcing the needed changes (in implementation and in mentality of the industry) prior to a disaster would be government regulation along the lines of Sarbanes-Oxley. In other words forcing CxOs to sign off they instituted mandated changes and that their security statements are correct. Those who know me know I generally don&rsquo;t favor creation of more regulation. However in this case I think it is the only solution short of letting a disaster occur.</p>

Lack of iPhone support means I'm not too interested though.<a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/29/amazon-officially-introduces-cloud-drive-music-service/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBoyGeniusReport+%28BGR+%7C+Boy+Genius+Report%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader"></a></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen several pundits criticizing the iPad 2 saying it is only a small improvement over the original iPad. Competitors surely aren&rsquo;t thinking so - including most who are only now managing to get their first version out. As usual the pundits err largely in looking at this Apple product as a standalone &ldquo;device&rdquo; forgetting (intentionally, I have to think at this point) that Apple products are part of a system, are very well built and run (generally) superior software with more diverse and useful applications. And in the iPad/tablet category Apple, for once, is not the high priced product. In fact it is on the lower end considering the screen size.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is the iPad 2 delivers on key features prospective users wanted. I&rsquo;m finally willing to buy an iPad and know a number of others who feel the iPad 2 has pushed over the crest and will now buy as well. There will be a buying frenzy come the 11th. My only complaint right now is I can&rsquo;t simply pre-order and expect one to show up. Read the below article on one competitor&rsquo;s surprisingly frank comments.</p>

Given the fact nearly every home has a network of computers to be managed, and information to share, this is great news. Until now the server features cost an additional $500.</p>

			 <p>This is a good read. If someone grabs your iPhone, jailbreaks it, and then follows a few steps they can grab passwords for things like email accounts, VPNs, WiFi networks, etc. Not cool and a fundamental flaw in iOS.

			 <p>We cannot afford to &ldquo;invest&rdquo; in more feel-good programs. It&rsquo;s time for significant spending reductions - taxation cannot fix the deficit. Attempted use of that single tool will result in an economic death spiral in America.</p>

<p>I agree taxation changes are needed and some of those should include very targeted increases. But our corporate tax rate must be reduced and the notion of ending the mortgage interest deduction killed immediately since a housing recovery is essential to the country&rsquo;s fiscal well-being. The Republicans need to show proper concern for the people of this country and the Democrats need to stop buying votes while bankrupting the country. Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;investment&rdquo; SOTU speech reminded me of an unpopular rich kid trying to use daddy&rsquo;s money to buy some friends.</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t have any inside info but I&rsquo;m 100% confident there is much more than meets the eyes of these recent top-end security hires by Apple. They definitely are not bringing in people of this caliber just to deal with security of their current systems or to work on vulnerabilities in their software. You can bet there is going to be a major initiative announced down the road. Mostly likely elaborating around the NFC (near field communications) rumors. Look for NFC to make a hardware appearance in the mid term with revenue generating initiatives ramping up soon after.</p>

			 <p>I hate to pick on the Democrats - because both parties are worthy targets of complaint - but when it comes to spending, the deficit and taxation they&rsquo;re the ones who spout the most foolish rhetoric and pursue the most damaging policies. Without a fiscally sound government no other policies can survive or prosper. The Dems like to say we just need to tax the rich more or tax everyone making above minimum wage more but the simple fact of the matter is even if we enact such changes it will <strong>not</strong> solve the deficit problem. And Hauser&rsquo;s &ldquo;Law&rdquo; along with other lessons from the past show that people have a way of adapting to higher taxation in ways that minimize or even avoid a rise in the government&rsquo;s revenue.</p>

<p>All of our Federal representatives need to face down the deficit/budget problem. But it is the Democrats falsely acting as if the problem can be solved by just taxing a few &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; who aren&rsquo;t paying their fair share. Perpetuating this notion in the mind of their backers is the one thing doing the most damage to gaining the popular support needed to reform our spending and hence guarantee a healthy future for our country. There is only one solution and that is to reduce Federal government spending. Politicians of both parties need to convince their constituents of this fact and then work to agree on the cuts needed. We can&rsquo;t afford to have spending cuts pushed through in the same &ldquo;gun to their head&rdquo; approach Pelosi and the Dems used to pass the health care &ldquo;reform&rdquo; legislation.</p>

			 <p>IMO the Mac App store is going to be a very big deal with ramifications far beyond the Mac user base. It is going to drive changes in app delivery (obviously), license and upgrade pricing, and the definition of a &ldquo;meets min&rdquo; application. Not just for Macs but for Windows too. Expect to see more &ldquo;bite size&rdquo; apps a la smartphone apps. Also expect to see in-app purchasing down the road.</p>

			 <p>In a good year for equities (the Dow was up over 10%) Hewlett-Packard is down 18%, Oracle is up nearly 30% and IBM matched the Dow. Hurd likes to blame the board of directors but it was his self-admitted actions that cost shareholders and employees millions of dollars. He has yet to take responsibility for the harm he did to others and continues to try to keep the facts from becoming public. I don&rsquo;t think his lasting reputation will ever be for anything more than a hatchet man.</p>

			 <p>For those directly effected the level of unemployment is certainly grim but overall the US economy is much sounder than most people realize. You will sometimes see a report about the stock market having recovered but even in these the main tone will be gloomy and other positives are not reported at all. However with the US real GDP (adjusted for inflation) now at pre-recession levels it is clear that more than the stock market has recovered. The obsession with the unemployment rate is counter-productive to helping it improve. The great majority of Americans are reasonably secure in their jobs, aren&rsquo;t in foreclosure, and are able to spend. The sooner their mindset changes the sooner the unemployment rate will drop. Not only will their return to a normal level of consumption drive jobs but their improved confidence is what is needed to trigger confidence in corporate America to once again invest in capital and new employees.</p>

			 <p>Or, what I really want for Christmas.</p>

<p>As the owner of a new MacBook Air (11&rdquo;) there are a few things I need that ya&rsquo;ll haven&rsquo;t created yet. I&rsquo;m saving you thousands in market research dollars by telling you what you need to create.</p>

<ol>
    <li>I want a stand. It only needs to do two things. First, securely hold the MBA in the vertical position. Second, it must act as a power dock. I.e. when I place the MBA vertically in the stand it will connect to the MagSafe port and charge the MBA.</li>
    <li>Although the 12" Targus Netbook sleeve does a decent job holding the MBA it's utilitarian style clashes. And I worry the zipper will scratch the Air as I slide it in and out since the zipper parts are exposed and it is a tight fit. While you're at it, please add a very discrete handle.</li>
    <li>I have a closet full of backpacks and messenger bags. They will all hold the MBA and even carry it in style. But the Air is so small putting it in a standard bag is like using a city bus to drive one person around town. Please create some bags scaled to my Air. And you better make 'em stylish. I know <a href="http://sfbags.com" target="_blank">SF Bags</a> has some that look good but they're impossible to obtain. Plus more options is always better.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a very good boy so please create this ASAP. My credit card is all ready to go!</p>

			 <p>I really prefer physical books for most things but decided a couple of books I needed to purchase provided a good chance to give e-books another try. Since I buy most books from Amazon they were my first stop and it was nice to see they have reader apps for the iPhone and Mac (as well as a bunch of other platforms). I decided to check Apple&rsquo;s iBook store and - rather shockingly - they don&rsquo;t have a iBook reader app for the Mac (to say nothing of Windows etc). I guess this is one of those Steve-isms but certainly not one I can agree with. Generally speaking when I purchase something I&rsquo;ll go with the technology that has the best chance of living a long time (in this case, more platforms means longer life and more versatility).</p>

<p>Needless to say I am now a Kindle customer.</p>

I love these @Gazelle guys :-) I&rsquo;ve sold several non-trivial electronic devices to them and the process and outcome have been consistently great. On this most recent sale (2.5 yo iMac) they are actually going to pay me $30 more than they quoted when I shipped it to them. It turns out it was better than they expected and worth more. Not sure what that means but I was impressed because they certainly could have stuck with the original estimated value and I would have been none-the-wiser and still a happy customer.</p>

			 <p>I was really looking forward to the release of AirPlay and my first day enjoying it was not a disappointment. We had some friends over for the evening and our quiet get together turned into a rockin&rsquo; evening as we used my iPhone to stream songs (mostly club mixes) and music videos through the AppleTV. &ldquo;How can you do that???&rdquo; was the understandable first reaction from our friends. Their second reaction was &ldquo;can I just go to the Apple store to buy one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>AirPlay is, to me, a great example of why Apple products are so popular. Apple products in a given category may not be &ldquo;the best in class&rdquo; but taken together as a lifestyle system there is absolutely no other company or product family that comes close. Technology implemented in such straightforward ways even my 6 year old can understand and use it with ease. It is getting harder and harder to resist buying a couple more Apple TVs for the house&hellip;</p>

			 <p>We started scouting early for Christmas gifts for our kids as there is so much &ldquo;looks good but is junk&rdquo; stuff on the market a bit of research is required. Yeah, I know, hard to believe it but that simply amazing toy heavily advertised on TV may end up in a drawer and never used.</p>

<p>As a result I just discovered, this year, it is impossible for me to decide what to buy in the store. Why? Because there are no customer reviews/ratings available. I could use my iPhone to look them up but no single site (I know of) has the critical mass of reviews required and the process would be too tedious. Yes there are barcode scanner apps good for price shopping but the ones I&rsquo;ve seen are no real help in consolidating reviews.</p>

<p>As a result I ended up taking pictures of the products in the store and once home I started hitting up the Amazons and ToyRUs of the world for the reviews. In the process I help but do price comparisons. Having done all that work, time I would have preferred spending on something more enjoyable, I&rsquo;m sure not going to bother to drive to the store to make my purchases. With the websites right in front of me that would rob me of even more of my valuable time.</p>

<p>The bottom line is even the largest, &ldquo;big box&rdquo;, brick-and-mortar stores are losing sales because they don&rsquo;t making it possible for me to decide on the spot what to purchase. They had me - I was there and ready to buy - and watched me walk out the door. So while these stores complain about damage caused by Internet shopping the reality is they should blame themselves for not being shopper friendly.</p>

			 <p>Glad to see a Tech leader blog about this tax - as US companies do more and more business overseas they face a heavy tax rate that effectively prevents them from bringing the funds home to invest in growth in the US. I just don&rsquo;t see how fixing this hasn&rsquo;t gained bipartisan support. It&rsquo;s not like we don&rsquo;t need more investment in job creation. Plus the jobs this would create are better paying and would yield more leverage than &ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; jobs the politicians typically create. This is clearly a case where letting the private sector spend the money would be far more efficient than having the government spend it (via taxation).</p>

Supposedly all the tracking is done to deliver &ldquo;behavioral&rdquo; advertising but we all know that in reality the companies could be doing anything they want with the data. The tool works by installing a &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; cookie which means you will need to run it on every computer/user account in order to completely opt out. Also, given the method used, an &ldquo;advertiser&rdquo; could ignore the opt out. That would be a violation - those never happen, right?</p>

<p>Safari users like myself have a convenient alternative. If you open Safari&rsquo;s preferences and go to the Security tab ensure the &ldquo;Only from sites I visit&rdquo; option is checked on the Accept Cookies section.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of the MacBook Air and <em>yawn</em> Lion got me thinking (a usually dangerous, sometimes expensive, situation). The MBA is one sexy device. It calls my name. Even more so than an iPad. But as soon as I let any rational thought enter the picture the MBA quickly takes second place to the iPad. Even though the MBA shares some cool features like instant on and SSD storage having to - gasp - open a lid to use a portable device now seems nearly pre-historic. I don&rsquo;t own an iPad but my iPhone 4 has completely hooked me on the idea of one-touch access to all my common needs. Yeah, there definitely is a market for something portable and cool that runs Mac OS apps instead of iOS. But apparently that is one market I don&rsquo;t belong to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had a chance to see some of the smaller tablets (7&rdquo; display sizes). At the moment I have to agree with Steve they are a very inferior experience. Not just because of their less capable software but, as he said, the smaller size really detracts from the experience. So, yeah there is a market for the smaller tablets and they are definitely not DOA. But it&rsquo;s another market segment I don&rsquo;t belong to.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping the next generation iPad is compelling enough to make me pull ¬†the trigger on a purchase. I think a front facing camera is about all it will take :-)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2010/10/12/154427.html">How my iPhone saved me $2,500</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I heard a debate last week over an analyst&rsquo;s claim that the iPad was cannibalizing sales of not just netbooks but also a whole range of consumer electronics devices - including TVs. I don&rsquo;t put much credence in that claim but it did kick off a train of thought and it didn&rsquo;t take me long to realize my iPhone actually <strong>had</strong> saved me money (or in analyst speak cannibalized sales of other devices). So herein I tally up expense-avoidance I attribute to my little &ldquo;pocket computer&rdquo;.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;line-height: 24px;font-size: 16px">My old Canon SD450 point &amp; shoot delivers images that are nearly always disappointing and I was keeping my eye on the Canon S90 as a replacement. With my old iPhone 3G I would have pulled the trigger before the holiday season. But the iPhone 4&rsquo;s camera is a big improvement, and is superior to the SD450, plus has the huge benefit of satisfying the adage that &ldquo;the best camera is the one you have with you.&rdquo; <strong>Savings: $400</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">The second purchase I&rsquo;ve avoided is a new laptop. My Titanium PowerBook is 7 years old and although it still works like a charm it is so hopelessly out-of-date as to be useless. It can&rsquo;t even join my wireless network since it doesn&rsquo;t support WPA. The OS is terribly backwards as well. Lacks FW800 and USB2 ports. Dot dot dot. I have a Windows laptop from my employer but I&rsquo;m a stickler for not putting personal info on it or using it for personal tasks. So a refurbished MacBook Pro was on my list for use when traveling or just away from home for awhile. Although the iPhone can&rsquo;t do everything I&rsquo;d expect the laptop to do it comes close enough that I no longer have a MacBook on my shopping list. <strong>Savings: $1,000</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000">My family really <strong>loves</strong> its music and we want it <strong>now</strong> and we want it <strong>here</strong> (here being wherever we are at home, including our home gym, or when running errands etc). Of course we all know the iPhone is an excellent iPod but also when combined with iTunes and the little Airport Express it provides a great whole-home audio streamer synced with our playlists. You can thank Airplay and Home Sharing for this. Just download the iPhone <em>Remote</em> app and you can pipe your music to one room or the whole house complete with visual playlists, album art and more. As a bonus you can stream to the new AppleTV as well. No need for an expensive one-trick-pony solution like Sonos. <strong>Savings: $500+</strong></span></p>

<p>Finally, lest you think Apple is completely benefiting from this train of thought, I have not purchased an iPad. Like a laptop, the iPad can be used in ways the iPhone can&rsquo;t. But overall the iPhone provides a good enough solution and satisfies the need for a a portable &ldquo;cool factor&rdquo; gadget. <strong>Savings: $600+</strong></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to run and tell my wife how much money I&rsquo;ve saved in buying my iPhone 4! Hey, the reasoning is at <em>least as good as</em> what I hear from her about how much money she &ldquo;saved&rdquo; buying stuff that is &ldquo;on sale.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p style="text-align: left">Logitech announced their GoogleTV device - pretty clear they are aiming for a different market than Apple is with the AppleTV. I like the keyboard but overall this device at this price point is something I would not have considered. It will definitely appeal to the techie and tinkering crowd more than the AppleTV does.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Further update on my AppleTV experience - took less than a week to be asked "can we have this on the other TVs too?". Another pleasant surprise - Netflix has a number of Thai language action movies.</p>

			 <p style="text-align: left">The Wall Street Journal is stating that Apple will start mass producing the iPhone for Verizon before this year is over. There have been a lot of rumors about this one (some of which were clearly false). But the WSJ has a pretty good track record so in spite of Verizon recently hinting the iPhone wasn't on deck this report does give some real reason to hope.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://ronguest.net/2010/10/04/153747.html">AppleTV: the Revolution has begun</a></h1>

			 <p>The title of this post will likely warm your heart, if you&rsquo;re an Apple fan, or irritate the heck out of you if you&rsquo;re neutral or a hater. Still, I write on and if you can stomach it read on because the ending may surprise you :-)</p>

<p>I first want to point out this isn&rsquo;t my first dip-of-the-toe in the waters of alternative entertainment distribution (i.e. non-cable/satellite). For about a year now I&rsquo;ve experimented with a whole range of solutions having variously run Plex, Boxee, XBMC and some homegrown &ldquo;media centers&rdquo; on a computer connected to our main HDTV. All of these prior solutions failed, based on my criteria, as they didn&rsquo;t meet the meets-min usability for our family - namely to be friendly, easy to use, and bulletproof for my 6 year old and preferably even for my 2 year old. Several of the media center solutions even failed the test for me, a tech geek, as they were too unstable or required too much administrative overhead in order to see the real benefit. I&rsquo;m convinced most of these solutions are for the sort of guy or gal who would buy an old Alfa Romeo. You simply have to love working on it in order to find it a good experience.</p>

<p>Enter the new AppleTV. I rarely buy the first generation of a new Apple product - still don&rsquo;t own an iPad, took me a couple years to decide an iPhone was worth it, and so on. And make no mistake - this new AppleTV shares nothing but a name with the &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; version and is indeed a first generation product.¬†Yet as soon as the announcement of the new AppleTV was out I immediately entered a pre-order and started preparing for it by relocating the media center computer, picking up an extra HDMI cable, and so on.</p>

<p>So I was ready to plug the AppleTV into our system the moment it arrived. My first impression was how small it is, second was how cool the combination of matte and glossy black finish looked. As always Apple showed design chops even though the AppleTV will generally be hidden once installed. In my case I plugged in an Ethernet cable (Gigabit), an HDMI cable and the power and I was immediately greeted by a very slick and clean UI. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like during the setup phase, <del datetime="2010-10-04T15:32:07+00:00">and have to imagine Apple will soon address</del> and Apple has already addressed, is the fact entering user names and passwords (for accounts like Netflix, YouTube, Flickr, etc.) is very tedious. Tons of scrolling and clicking. The same day the AppleTV arrived Apple released an update to the iPhone/iPad Remote application enabling you to do your typing on the virtual keyboard. Very nice! Here&rsquo;s a summary of my opinion - read on for the gory details.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_87&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;642&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;The Good and the Bad&rdquo;][/caption]</p>

<p>The most striking aspect of the AppleTV has been it&rsquo;s stability. The family has used it for hours and we have yet to see a streaming glitch or UI problem. I presume the device is using it&rsquo;s hefty amount of RAM to do unusually large buffering. Performance of Netflix streaming to the AppleTV is definitely more reliable than to any of the computers connected to the same network (which use Flash and Silverlight I believe). YouTube streaming works equally well.</p>

<p>iTunes rentals are pretty convenient but be warned it asks for the CVV code on the back of your credit card. For adults I think that is a fine solution. But to allow kiddos to rent content, if you&rsquo;re a trusting parent, a user-settable code would be preferable.</p>

<p>iTunes rental image quality is outstanding at 720p. Yeah, our set is 1080p and so it isn&rsquo;t quite as good as we could get with a directly connected 1080p source. But at 720p the image quality is superior to nearly all cable and satellite distributed content and is superior to the Roku based on the comparisons I&rsquo;ve seen. Playing a rented iTunes movie and comparing it to the same movie streamed by Netflix really highlights the inferior technology Netflix uses even over a solid network connection. Of course for the price of two average iTunes movie rentals you get to stream all the Netflix content you can handle for a month&hellip;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also using the AppleTV to stream content from our own library stored on a Mac Mini used as a server. We have DVDs, family movies, TV shows and a large photo library (used as our screensaver). Getting this to work is brain-dead simple since you only need to turn on Home Sharing on the AppleTV and computer to make this happen. I did notice, however, that the AppleTV does not see iTunes media on our NAS which uses Firefly. Home Sharing is apparently required and at least for now that is a closed protocol.</p>

<p>So what do I think about this $99 purchase? For this family of 4 (mom, dad, and children 6 and 2 years old) it is a great addition. It is immediately usable with no training required even for the 6 year old. It seems bulletproof. It successfully delivers the content we care about and, with the Remote app, even searching of contacts and content is a breeze. But in the end <strong>this review isn&rsquo;t</strong> particularly <strong>about the AppleTV</strong> - it&rsquo;s about the Revolution in content distribution. For the first time it is obvious that the technology needed to divorce ourselves from the communistic content control of the cable and satellite companies is ready for the mainstream. I&rsquo;ve seen a few people slam the AppleTV as being &ldquo;handicapped&rdquo; so only suitable for &ldquo;mom&rdquo; or &ldquo;grandma&rdquo;. Frankly, that is the point of a ¬†revolution - it must be populist and hence meaningful and beneficial to masses. Apple has proved it is doable. I&rsquo;m sure Google and the typical cast of characters will follow suit. Well, except Microsoft. They can never get anything right for consumers.</p>

			 <p>With my family equally anxious to start using the new AppleTV I knew I needed to get ahead of the curve and complete the prep work. In my case this meant relocating the Mac Mini, which serves as a media server/streamer/backup device, from the entertainment center in the family room to a cabinet in the upstairs playroom. I had earlier done some upstairs prep work, namely installing a UPS, power strip and Ethernet cable. Completing the Mini&rsquo;s relocation took a bit longer than expected since there was an issue with the cat 5e cable. While at it I set up the Mac Mini with a Bluetooth Apple keyboard and used a spare monitor as a ¬†temporary display. (The Mini used to be connected to a TV which served as a display). Seemed straightforward enough until&hellip;</p>

<p>I did a file system check on the 2TB external drive using Disk Utility and found not only were there file system errors but to make it worse Disk Utility couldn&rsquo;t repair them. This was Defcon 4 from the family standpoint as the 2TB external drive holds the media streamed throughout the house, sync&rsquo;d to iPhones, and would be a key source for the AppleTV. Fortunately I have backups :-) So I kicked off restores from my backups and let them run overnight.</p>

<p>As of this morning the backup is nearly done - most importantly all the entertainment media has been restored - and FedEx is reporting that my AppleTV is on a truck in da hood and should arrive within 2 hours. Let the fun begin!</p>
